abstract = {We provide a categorical framework for models of a type theory that has special types for physical quantities. The types are indexed by the physical dimensions that they involve. Fibrations are used to organize this index structure in the models of the type theory. We develop some informative models of this type theory: firstly, a model based on group actions, which captures invariance under scaling, and secondly, a way of constructing new models using relational parametricity.},

abstract = {Machines powered by artificial intelligence increasingly mediate our social, cultural, economic and political interactions. Understanding the behaviour of artificial intelligence systems is essential to our ability to control their actions, reap their benefits and minimize their harms. Here we argue that this necessitates a broad scientific research agenda to study machine behaviour that incorporates and expands upon the discipline of computer science and includes insights from across the sciences. We first outline a set of questions that are fundamental to this emerging field and then explore the technical, legal and institutional constraints on the study of machine behaviour.},

@article{Weede2003,
abstract = {In the late 1970s, the economic size ratio between the Soviet Union and China was 4 to 1. In 2001, the ratio between Russia and China was less than 1 to 4, or even less than 1 to 5, if one includes Hong Kong with China. Although the collapse and dissolution of the Soviet Union contributed to this profound reversal of economic strength, domestic factors have been more important: decollectivization of Chinese agriculture versus an unwillingness to reform in Russia, the establishment of township village enterprises in China versus an extremely weak small and medium enterprise sector in Russia, economic openness and market-preserving federalism in China versus limited participation in globalization and confused federalism in Russia. Although Russia was faster than China in privatizing state-owned enterprises, the preferential treatment of insiders and the weakness of the rule of law or functional substitutes for it neutralized this potential Russian advantage. The strength and character of Chinese nationalism might also help it to outgrow Russia. While the rise of China and the corresponding power transitions imply security risks, reinforced by China's central geopolitical location, there are also opportunities, because of the pacifying impact of free trade and globalization and prospects for democratization. By trade China might become prosperous and, ultimately, even democratic. In the long run, a "capitalist peace" between China, Russia, and the West is conceivable.},

@article{Tsujii2017,
abstract = {Objectives To evaluate the relationship between the initial diameters of the coronary arteries immediately after the onset of Kawasaki disease (KD) and late increased coronary wall thickening/coronary artery calcification (CAC). Study Design Sixty-five patients (50 males and 15 females) who had undergone selective coronary angiography (CAG) {\textless}100 days after the onset of KD were studied late in disease by dual-source computed tomography (DSCT). The maximum diameters of each segment were measured in the initial CAGs, and the relationship between the maximum diameters and the appearance of increased wall thickening/CAC was analyzed. The study cohort was divided into 2 groups: the branches group (BG) and bifurcation at the left coronary artery (LCA) group. The cutoff point of acute coronary artery dilatation for increased wall thickening/CAC was calculated for each group. Risk factors for the appearance of CAC in each group were investigated, as was the sex difference related to the prevalence of CAC in coronary artery lesions (CALs) of the initial CAGs. Results The cutoff points of acute coronary dilatation for increased wall thickening were 4.8 mm in the BG (n = 344; area under the curve [AUC], 0.89; P {\textless} .001) and 5.3 mm in the LCA group (n = 65; AUC, 0.87; P {\textless} .001). The interval from the onset of KD (P {\textless} .0001) and sex (P = .0084) were also related to the appearance of CAC in the BG. Conclusion Acute coronary dilatation of exceeding {\~{}}5.0 mm can lead to late abnormalities of the coronary artery wall. The prevalence of CAC increases with age. There was a sex-based difference in the late incidence of CAC in the CALs.},

The book is oriented to the practitioner. A basic understanding of the linear regression model with matrix algebra is assumed. The text can be used for a microeconometrics course, typically a second-year economics PhD course; for data-oriented applied microeconometrics field courses; and as a reference work for graduate students and applied researchers who wish to fill in gaps in their toolkit. Distinguishing features of the book include emphasis on nonlinear models and robust inference, simulation-based estimation, and problems of complex survey data. The book makes frequent use of numerical examples based on generated data to illustrate the key models and methods. More substantially, it systematically integrates into the text empirical illustrations based on seven large and exceptionally rich data sets.},

@article{Lake2017,
abstract = {Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes towards these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.},

abstract = {Process algebra is the study of distributed or parallel systems by algebraic means. Originating in computer science, process algebra has been extended in recent years to encompass not just discrete-event systems, but also continuously evolving phenomena, resulting in so-called hybrid process algebras. A hybrid process algebra can be used for the specification, simulation, control and verification of embedded systems in combinationwith their environment, and for any dynamic systemin general. As the vehicle of our exposition,we use the hybrid process algebra $\chi$ (Chi). The syntax and semantics of $\chi$ are discussed, and it is explained how equational reasoning simplifies tool implementations for simulation and verification. A bottle filling line example is introduced to illustrate system analysis by means of equational reasoning.},

Abstract We use reinforcement learning (RL) to learn dexterous in-hand manipulation policies which can perform vision-based object reorientation on a physical Shadow Dexterous Hand. The training is performed in a simulated environment in which we randomize many of the physical properties of the system like friction coefficients and an object's appearance. Our policies transfer to the physical robot despite being trained entirely in simulation. Our method does not rely on any human demonstrations, but many behaviors found in human manipulation emerge naturally, including finger gaiting, multi-finger coordination, and the controlled use of gravity. Our results were obtained using the same distributed RL system that was used to train OpenAI Five [43]. We also include a video of our results: https://youtu. be/jwSbzNHGflM.},

If overinvestment might be an issue, delegation (possibly with restricted competencies) is optimal if additionally some continuity requirements are met.

It is shown that nonequilibrium may become a source of order and that irreversible processes may lead to a new type of dynamic states of matter called "dissipative structures." The thermodynamic theory of such structures is outlined. A microscopic definition of irreversible processes is given, and a transformation theory is developed that allows one to introduce nonunitary equations of motion that explicitly display irreversibility and approach to thermodynamic equilibrium. The work of the group at the University of Brussels in these fields is briefly reviewed. In this new development of theoretical chemistry and physics, it is likely that thermodynamic concepts will play an ever increasing role},

abstract = {We present an in-depth coverage of the comprehensive machine-checked formal verification of seL4, a general-purpose operating system microkernel. We discuss the kernel design we used to make its verification tractable. We then describe the functional correctness proof of the kernel's C implementation and we cover further steps that transform this result into a comprehensive formal verification of the kernel: a formally verified IPC fastpath, a proof that the binary code of the kernel correctly implements the C semantics, a proof of correct access-control enforcement, a proof of information-flow noninterference, a sound worst-case execution time analysis of the binary, and an automatic initialiser for user-level systems that connects kernel-level access-control enforcement with reasoning about system behaviour. We summarise these results and show how they integrate to form a coherent overall analysis, backed by machine-checked, end-to-end theorems. The seL4 microkernel is currently not just the only general-purpose operating system kernel that is fully formally verified to this degree. It is also the only example of formal proof of this scale that is kept current as the requirements, design and implementation of the system evolve over almost a decade. We report on our experience in maintaining this evolving formally verified code base. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM 0734-2071/2014/02- ART3 {\$}15.00.},

@article{VanLith2001,
abstract = {The traditional use of ergodic theory in the foundations of equilibrium statistical mechanics is that it provides a link between thermodynamic observables and microcanonical probabilities. First of all, the ergodic theorem demonstrates the equality of microcanonical phase averages and infinite time averages (albeit for a special class of systems, and up to a measure zero set of exceptions). Secondly, one argues that actual measurements of thermodynamic quantities yield time averaged quantities, since measurements take a long time. The combination of these two points is held to be an explanation why calculating microcanonical phase averages is a successful algorithm for predicting the values of thermodynamic observables. It is also well known that this account is problematic. This survey intends to show that ergodic theory nevertheless may have important roles to play, and it explores three other uses of ergodic theory. Particular attention is paid, firstly, to the relevance of specific interpretations of probability, and secondly, to the way in which the concern with systems in thermal equilibrium is translated into probabilistic language. With respect to the latter point, it is argued that equilibrium should not be represented as a stationary probability distribution as is standardly done; instead, a weaker definition is presented. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Consideration of the post-General Theor-v literature reveals that a key aspect of that link concerns the velocity of circulation of money. The Keynesian emphasis on compartmentalizing the demand for money into active and idle components resulted in a mechanical interpretation of velocity and the associated view that monciy does not matter, The monetarist tradition illustrates the behavioral perspective adduced to velocity via adaptive price expectations by earlier quantity theorists leading to a capital-theoretic reformulation of the quantity theory in terms of a stable demand function for money.},

Many notions and results have two distinct versions—a western version dealing with arbitrary formulas and an eastern version dealing with quantifier-free formulas. The deeper proofs in model theory usually depend on the construction of a model with certain properties. The constructions almost always use elementary chains, diagrams and other expansions of the language, compactness theorem, downward Lowenheim–Skolem theorem, omitting type theorem, forcing, ultraproducts, and homogeneous sets. The chapter concentrates on the simplest nontrivial language, first order logic. For some applications, many-sorted logic is more natural. {\textcopyright} 1977, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, whereas machine learning grew out of computer science. However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years. In particular, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic models. Also, the practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced through the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propa- gation. Similarly, new models based on kernels have had significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a compre- hensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners, and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or ma- chine learning concepts. Knowledge of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some familiarity with probabilities would be helpful though not es- sential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.},

The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.},

(ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN; CONTROL; ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS) 1. iBtrotostkm Organizational control has many meanings and has been interpreted in many ways. Tannenbaum [42], whose view has dominated organizational theory, interprets control as the sum of interpersonal influence relations in an organization. In a similar vein, Etzioni [13] finds it useful to treat control in organizations as equivalent to power. Other than the power-influence approach to control, organization theorists have also treated control as a problem in information flows (Galbraith [15], Ouchi and Maguire [30]), as a problem in creating and monitoring rules through a hierarchical authority system as specified by Weber [46] and interpreted by Perrow [33], Blau and Scott [7], and many organizational sociologists, and as a cybernetic process of testing, measur-ing, and providing fe{\^{}}back (Thompson [43], Reeves and Woodward [35{\^{}}.

While the theory of identity types was originally intended to internalize the notion of equality in type theory, and thereby enableing one to prove equality of two terms by inhabiting the corresponding identity types, it has become apparent in the last decade that it provides a setting for doing formal homotopy theory. The main idea was to interpret a proof of equality for two terms a and b as a path from a to b. The pioneers of this interpretation were Steve Awodey, Michael Warren and Vladimir Voevodsky and the theory that resulted from their work is currently intensively investigated, both from it's type theoretical side and by providing new models for the theory. This thesis could be seen as a report on the recent type theoretical results in this program},

After an introductory chapter giving the basic definitions, separate chapters explain three ways of expressing universal properties: via adjoint functors, representable functors, and limits. A final chapter ties all three together. The book is suitable for use in courses or for independent study. Assuming relatively little mathematical background, it is ideal for beginning graduate students or advanced undergraduates learning category theory for the first time. For each new categorical concept, a generous supply of examples is provided, taken from different parts of mathematics. At points where the leap in abstraction is particularly great (such as the Yoneda lemma), the reader will find careful and extensive explanations. Copious exercises are included.},

Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A randomized algorithm is one that makes random choices during its execution. The behavior of such an algorithm may thus be random even on a fixed input. The design and analysis of a randomized algorithm focus on establishing that it is likely to behave well on every input; the likelihood in such a statement depends only on the probabilistic choices made by the algorithm during execution and not on any assumptions about the input. It is especially important to distinguish a randomized algorithm from the average-case analysis of algorithms, where one analyzes an algorithm assuming that its input is drawn from a fixed probability distribution. With a randomized algorithm, in contrast, no assumption is made about the input.},

abstract = {Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) attempts to infer human rewards or preferences from observed behavior. Since human planning systematically deviates from rationality, several approaches have been tried to account for specific human shortcomings. However, the general problem of inferring the reward function of an agent of unknown rationality has received little attention. Unlike the well-known ambiguity problems in IRL, this one is practically relevant but cannot be resolved by observing the agent's policy in enough environments. This paper shows (1) that a No Free Lunch result implies it is impossible to uniquely decompose a policy into a planning algorithm and reward function, and (2) that even with a reasonable simplicity prior/Occam's razor on the set of decompositions, we cannot distinguish between the true decomposition and others that lead to high regret. To address this, we need simple `normative' assumptions, which cannot be deduced exclusively from observations.},

We curate 7,500 natural adversarial examples and release them in an ImageNet classifier test set that we call ImageNet-A. This dataset serves as a new way to measure classifier robustness. Like l{\_}p adversarial examples, ImageNet-A examples successfully transfer to unseen or black-box classifiers. For example, on ImageNet-A a DenseNet-121 obtains around 2{\%} accuracy, an accuracy drop of approximately 90{\%}. Recovering this accuracy is not simple because ImageNet-A examples exploit deep flaws in current classifiers including their over-reliance on color, texture, and background cues. We observe that popular training techniques for improving robustness have little effect, but we show that some architectural changes can enhance robustness to natural adversarial examples. Future research is required to enable robust generalization to this hard ImageNet test set.},

The ``predictive information'' defined in this way has connections to measures of complexity that have been proposed both in the study of dynamical systems and in mathematical statistics. In particular, the predictive information diverges when the observed data stream allows us to learn an increasingly precise model for the dynamics that generate the data, and the structure of this divergence measures the complexity of the model. We argue that divergent contributions to the predictive information provide the only measure of complexity or richness that is consistent with certain plausible requirements.},

It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.},

The answers tell us which information and influence points need extra protection. For example, we may want a classifier for job applications to not use the ethnicity of the candidate, and a reinforcement learning agent not to take direct control of its reward mechanism. Different algorithms and training paradigms can lead to different causal influence diagrams, so our method can be used to identify algorithms with problematic incentives and help in designing algorithms with better incentives.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The health care system of the United States is examined from the end of the 19th century to the present, using secondary sources on labor and health care. During that period, several actors, each with its own priorities, exercised control over the United States (US) health services: physicians (from the 1900s on), hospitals and not-for-profit insurance (from the 1930s on), governmental regulators (from the 1960s on), and, lastly, for-profit managed care enterprises (from the 1980s on). A class contest between corporations and labor was involved at two critical points. In the 1870s to 1890s (with further steps in the 1920s and, with the Taft-Hartley law, in 1947), it weakened the labor movement that was unable to mount a successful effort for a national health program in 1972 and 1992. In the 1980s and 1990s, as health services developed into a major industry, two contending business groups (health plans and payers) took commanding positions over consumers and employees. Market-oriented, for-profit managed care organizations came to play a dominant role. During that period, access to, and, by some measures, quality of care has declined. The rise in health care costs has been interrupted, but it is not clear how long this will last. European nations that are reforming their health care system, should be wary of such profit-oriented market approaches to bring costs down.},

abstract = {Type systems for programming languages with numeric types can be extended to support the checking of units of measure. Quantification over units then introduces a new kind of parametric polymorphism with a corresponding Reynolds-style representation independence principle: that the behaviour of programs is invariant under changes to the units used. We prove this 'dimensional invariance' result and describe four consequences. The first is that the type of an expression can be used to derive equations which describe its properties with respect to scaling (akin to Wadler's 'theorems for free' for System F). Secondly there are certain types which are inhabited only by trivial terms. For example, we prove that a fully polymorphic square root function cannot be written using just the usual arithmetic primitives. Thirdly we exhibit interesting isomorphisms between types and for first-order types relate these to the central we suggest that for any expression whose behaviour is dimensionally invariant there exists some equivalent expression whose type reflects this behaviour, a consequence of which would be a full abstraction result for a model of the language.},

This is work in progress toward showing that both categories embed faithfully and bijectively-on-objects into instances of a pattern we call categories of dioptics, whose name and definition both build heavily on [Ril18]. Using a generalization of the reverse-mode automatic differentiation functor of [Ell18] to arbitrary diffeological spaces with trivializable tangent bundles, we also construct a category of gradient-based learners which generalizes gradient-based learning beyond Euclidean parameter spaces. We aim to show that this category embeds naturally into the category of learners (with a choice of update rule and loss function), and that composing this embedding with reverse-mode automatic differentiation (and the inclusion of Euclidean spaces into trivializable diffeological spaces) recovers the backpropagation functor L of [FST18].},

INSTITUTIONS AND NAMES$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nViolence was a fire which swept over the fields of El Salvador; it$\backslash$nburst into villages, cut off roads and destroyed highways and bridges,$\backslash$nenergy sources and transmission lines; it reached the cities and$\backslash$nentered families, sacred areas and educational centres; it struck$\backslash$nat justice and filled the public administration with victims; and$\backslash$nit singled out as an enemy anyone who was not on the list of friends.$\backslash$nViolence turned everything to death and destruction, for such is$\backslash$nthe senselessness of that breach of the calm plenitude which accompanies$\backslash$nthe rule of law, the essential nature of violence being suddenly$\backslash$nor gradually to alter the certainty which the law nurtures in human$\backslash$nbeings when this change does not take place through the normal mechanisms$\backslash$nof the rule of law. The victims were Salvadorians and foreigners$\backslash$nof all backgrounds and all social and economic classes, for in its$\backslash$nblind cruelty violence leaves everyone equally defenceless.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWhen there came pause for thought, Salvadorians put their hands to$\backslash$ntheir hearts and felt them pound with joy. No one was winning the$\backslash$nwar, everyone was losing it. Governments of friendly countries and$\backslash$norganizations the world over that had looked on in anguish at the$\backslash$ntragic events in that Central American country which, although small,$\backslash$nwas made great by the creativity of its people -all contributed their$\backslash$nideas to the process of reflection. A visionary, Javier P{\'{e}}rez de$\backslash$nCu{\'{e}}llar, then Secretary-General of the United Nations, heeded the$\backslash$nunanimous outcry and answered it. The Presidents of Colombia, Mexico,$\backslash$nSpain and Venezuela supported him. The Chapultepec Agreement expressed$\backslash$nthe support of the new Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,$\backslash$nfor the search for reconciliation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nB. THE CREATIVE CONSEQUENCES$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOn the long road of the peace negotiations, the need to reach agreement$\backslash$non a Commission on the Truth arose from the Parties recognition that$\backslash$nthe communism which had encouraged one side had collapsed, and perhaps$\backslash$nalso from the disillusionment of the Power which had encouraged the$\backslash$nother. It emerged as a link in the chain of reflection and agreement$\backslash$nand was motivated, ultimately, by the impact of events on Salvadorian$\backslash$nsociety, which now faced the urgent task of confronting the issue$\backslash$nof the widespread, institutionalized impunity which had struck at$\backslash$nits very heart: under the protection of State bodies but outside$\backslash$nthe law, repeated human rights violations had been committed by members$\backslash$nof the armed forces; these same rights had also been violated by$\backslash$nmembers of the guerrilla forces.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIn response to this situation, the negotiators agreed that such repugnant$\backslash$nacts should be referred to a Commission on the Truth, which was the$\backslash$nname they agreed to give it from the outset. Unlike the Ad Hoc Commission,$\backslash$nso named because there was no agreement on what to call the body$\backslash$ncreated to purify the armed forces, the Commission on the Truth was$\backslash$nso named because its very purpose and function were to seek, find$\backslash$nand publicize the truth about the acts of violence committed by both$\backslash$nsides during the war.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, as the oath$\backslash$ngoes. The overall truth and the specific truth, the radiant but quiet$\backslash$ntruth. The whole and its parts, in other words, the bright light$\backslash$nshone onto a surface to illuminate it and the parts of this same$\backslash$nsurface lit up case by case, regardless of the identity of the perpetrators,$\backslash$nalways in the search for lessons that would contribute to reconciliation$\backslash$nand to abolishing such patterns of behaviour in the new society.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLearning the truth and strengthening and tempering the determination$\backslash$nto find it out; putting an end to impunity and cover-up; settling$\backslash$npolitical and social differences by means of agreement instead of$\backslash$nviolent action: these are the creative consequences of an analytical$\backslash$nsearch for the truth.},

abstract = {I present a framework for analyzing decision making under imperfect understanding of correlation structures and causal relations. A decision maker (DM) faces an objective long-run probability distribution p over several variables (including the action taken by previous DMs). The DM is characterized by a subjective causal model, represented by a directed acyclic graph over the set of variable labels. The DM attempts to fit this model to p, resulting in a subjective belief that distorts p by factorizing it according to the graph via the standard Bayesian network formula. As a result of this belief distortion, the DM's evaluation of actions can vary with their long-run frequencies. Accordingly, I define a ''personal equilibrium'' notion of individual behavior. The framework enables simple graphical representations of causal-attribution errors (such as coarseness or reverse causation), and provides tools for checking rationality properties of the DM's behavior. I demonstrate the framework's scope of applications with examples covering diverse areas, from demand for education to public policy. JEL Code: D03.},

abstract = {When an individual performs several tasks simultaneously, processing resources must be allocated to different brain systems to produce energy for neurons to fire. Following the evidence from neuroscience, we model the brain as an organization in which a coordinator allocates limited resources to the brain systems responsible for the different tasks. Systems are privately informed about the amount of resources necessary to perform their task and compete to obtain the resources. The coordinator arbitrates the demands while satisfying the resource constraint. We show that the optimal mechanism is to impose to each system with privately known needs a cap in resources that depends negatively on the amountof resources requested by the other system. This allocation can be implemented using a biologically plausible mechanism. Finally, we provide some implications of our theory: (i) performance can be flawless for sufficiently simple tasks, (ii) the dynamic allocation rule exhibits inertia (current allocations are increasing in past needs), and (iii) different cognitive tasks are performed by different systems only if the tasks are sufficiently important. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

It focuses extensively on real-world signal processing applications, including state-of-the-art speech and communications technology as well as traditional sonar/radar systems.   Start with a quick review of the fundamental issues associated with mathematical detection, as well as the most important probability density functions and their properties. Next, review Gaussian, Chi-Squared, F, Rayleigh, and Rician PDFs, quadratic forms of Gaussian random variables, asymptotic Gaussian PDFs, and Monte Carlo Performance Evaluations.   Three chapters introduce the basics of detection based on simple hypothesis testing, including the Neyman-Pearson Theorem, handling irrelevant data, Bayes Risk, multiple hypothesis testing, and both deterministic and random signals.   The author then presents exceptionally detailed coverage of composite hypothesis testing to accommodate unknown signal and noise parameters. These chapters will be especially useful for those building detectors that must work with real, physical data. Other topics covered include:     Detection in nonGaussian noise, including nonGaussian noise characteristics, known deterministic signals, and deterministic signals with unknown parameters   Detection of model changes, including maneuver detection and time-varying PSD detection   Complex extensions, vector generalization, and array processing    The book makes extensive use of MATLAB, and program listings are included wherever appropriate.

abstract = {Neural network pruning techniques can reduce the parameter counts of trained networks by over 90{\%}, decreasing storage requirements and improving computational performance of inference without compromising accuracy. However, contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures produced by pruning are difficult to train from the start, which would similarly improve training performance. We find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the lottery ticket hypothesis: dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks (winning tickets) that-when trained in isolation-reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective. We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 10-20{\%} of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning tickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher test accuracy.},

abstract = {Algorithmic randomness provides a rigorous, entropylike measure of disorder of an individual, microscopic, definite state of a physical system. It is defined by the size (in binary digits) of the shortest message specifying the microstate uniquely up to the assumed resolution. Equivalently, algorithmic randomness can be expressed as the number of bits in the smallest program for a universal computer that can reproduce the state in question (for instance, by plotting it with the assumed accuracy). In contrast to the traditional definitions of entropy, algorithmic randomness can be used to measure disorder without any recourse to probabilities. Algorithmic randomness is typically very difficult to calculate exactly but relatively easy to estimate. In large systems, probabilistic ensemble definitions of entropy (e.g., coarse-grained entropy of Gibbs and Boltzmanns entropy H=lnW, as well as Shannons information-theoretic entropy) provide accurate estimates of the algorithmic entropy of an individual system or its average value for an ensemble. One is thus able to rederive much of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics in a setting very different from the usual. Physical entropy, I suggest, is a sum of (i) the missing information measured by Shannons formula and (ii) of the algorithmic information contentalgorithmic randomnesspresent in the available data about the system. This definition of entropy is essential in describing the operation of thermodynamic engines from the viewpoint of information gathering and using systems. These Maxwell demon-type entities are capable of acquiring and processing information and therefore can decide on the basis of the results of their measurements and computations the best strategy for extracting energy from their surroundings. From their internal point of view the outcome of each measurement is definite. The limits on the thermodynamic efficiency arise not from the ensemble considerations, but rather reflect basic laws of computation. Thus inclusion of algorithmic randomness in the definition of physical entropy allows one to formulate thermodynamics from the Maxwell demons point of view. {\textcopyright} 1989 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Introduction The Shia shahadah (declaration of faith) states:  "There is no god but All{\'{a}}h, Muhammad is the Messenger of All{\'{a}}h, Al{\'{i}} is the Friend of All{\'{a}}h. The Successor of the Messenger of All{\'{a}}h And his first Caliph."  If you are already familiar with standard Sunni beliefs, you will immediately notice the addition to the shahadah regarding Imam Ali (ra), cousin of the Prophet (pbuh), husband of his daughter Fatima, father of Hassan and Hussein and the second person ever to embrace Islam. The term Shia or Shi'ite derives from a shortening of Shiat Ali or partisans of Ali.  History Ali is the central figure at the origin of the Shia / Sunni split which occurred in the decades immediately following the death of the Prophet in 632. Sunnis regard Ali as the fourth and last of the "rightly guided caliphs" (successors to Mohammed (pbuh) as leader of the Muslims) following on from Abu Bakr 632-634, Umar 634-644 and Uthman 644-656. Shias feel that Ali should have been the first caliph and that the caliphate should pass down only to direct descendants of Mohammed (pbuh) via Ali and Fatima, They often refer to themselves as ahl al bayt or "people of the house" [of the prophet].  When Uthman was murdered while at prayer, Ali finally succeeded to the caliphate. Ali was, however, opposed by Aisha, wife of the Prophet (pbuh) and daughter of Abu Bakr, who accused him of being lax in bringing Uthman's killers to justice. After Ali's army defeated Aisha's forces at the Battle of the Camel in 656, she apologized to Ali and was allowed to return to her home in Madinah where she withdrew from public life.  However, Ali was not able to overcome the forces of Mu'awiya Ummayad, Uthman's cousin and governor of Damascus, who also refused to recognize him until Uthman's killers had been apprehended. At the Battle of Suffin Mu'awiya's soldiers stuck verses of the Quran onto the ends of their spears with the result that Ali's pious supporters refused to fight them. Ali was forced to seek a compromise with Mu'awiya, but this so shocked some of his die-hard supporters who regarded it as a betrayal that he was struck down by one of his own men in 661.  Mu'awiya declared himself caliph. Ali's elder son Hassan accepted a pension in return for not pursuing his claim to the caliphate. He died within a year, allegedly poisoned. Ali's younger son Hussein agreed to put his claim to the caliphate on hold until Mu'awiya's death. However, when Mu'awiya finally died in 680, his son Yazid usurped the caliphate. Hussein led an army against Yazid but, hopelessly outnumbered, he and his men were slaughtered at the Battle of Karbala (in modern day Iraq). Hussein's infant son, Ali, survived so the line continued. Yazid formed the hereditary Ummayad dynasty. The division between the Shia and what came to be known as the Sunni was set.  An opportunity for Muslim unity arose in the 750's CE. In 750 except for a few who managed to flee to Spain, almost the entire Ummayad aristocracy was wiped out following the Battle of Zab in Egypt in a revolt led by Abu Al Abbass al-Saffah and aided by considerable Shia support. It was envisaged that the Shia spiritual leader Jafar As-Siddiq, great-grandson of Hussein be installed as Caliph. But when Abbass died in 754, this arrangement had not yet been finalised and Abbas' son Al Mansur murdered Jafar, seized the caliphate for himself and founded the Baghdad-based Abbassid dynasty which prevailed until the sack of Baghdad by the Mongols in 1258.  Theological Differences and Attempts at promoting Unity  The line of Mohammed (pbuh) through Ali and Hussein became extinct in 873CE when the last Shia Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, who had no brothers disappeared within days of inheriting the title at the age of four. The Shias refused, however, to accept that he had died, preferring to believe that he was merely "hidden" and would return. When after several centuries this failed to happen, spiritual power passed to the ulema, a council of twelve scholars who elected a supreme Imam. The best known modern example of the Shia supreme Imam is the late Ayyatollah Khomeni, whose portrait hangs in many Shia homes. The Shia Imam has come to be imbued with Pope-like infallibility and the Shia religious hierarchy is not dissimilar in structure and religious power to that of the Catholic Church within Christianity. Sunni Islam, in contrast, more closely resembles the myriad independent churches of American Protestantism.  Sunnis do not have a formal clergy, just scholars and jurists, who may offer non-binding opinions.  Shias believe that their supreme Imam is a fully spiritual guide, inheriting some of Muhammad's inspiration ("light") .  Their imams are believed to be inerrant interpreters of law and tradition.  Shia theology is distinguished by its glorification of Ali.  In Shia Islam there is a strong theme of martyrdom and suffering, focusing on deaths of Ali and, particularly, Hussein plus other important figures in the Shia succession.  Shi`ism attracted other dissenting groups, especially representatives of older non-Arab (Mawali) civilizations (Persian, Indian, etc.) that felt they had not been treated fairly by the Arab Muslims.  Sunnis and Shias agree on the core fundamentals of Islam - the Five Pillars - and recognize each others as Muslims.  In 1959 Sheikh Mahmood Shaltoot, Head of the School of Theology at Al Azhar university in Cairo, the most august seat of learning of Sunni Islam and the oldest university in the world, issued a fatwa (ruling) recognizing the legitimacy of the Jafari School of Law to which most Shias belong.  As a point of interest, the Jafari School  is named after its founder Imam Jafaf Sidiq who was a direct descendent through two different lines of the Sunni Caliph Abu Bakr.  And Al Azhar University, though now Sunni, was actually founded by the Shia Fatimid dynasty in 969CE.  However, there remain significant differences between the two forms of Islam and these are what tend to be emphasized.  Many Sunni's would contend that Shias seem to take the fundamentals of Islam very much for granted, shunting them into the background and dwelling on the martyrdoms of Ali and Hussein. This is best illustrated at Ashura when each evening over a period of ten days the Shias commemorate the Battle of Karbala, with a wailing Imam whipping the congregation up into a frenzy of tears and chest beating. It is alleged that instead of missionary work to non-Muslims, the Shia harbor a deep-seated disdain towards Sunni Islam and prefer to devote their attention to winning over other Muslims to their group. There is ongoing violent strife between Sunnis and Shias in Pakistan. On the other hand, in recent years there has been signification co-operation between the two groups in the Lebanon.  And some of the most dynamic developments in Islam today are taking place in Shia-dominated Iran.  Practical Differences  On a practical daily level, Shias have a different call to prayer, they perform wudu and salat differently including placing the forehead onto a piece of hardened clay from Karbala, not directly onto the prayer mat when prostrating. They also tend to combine prayers, sometimes worshipping three times per day instead of five. The Shias also have some different ahadith and prefer those narrated by Ali and Fatima to those related by other companions of the Prophet (pbuh). Because of her opposition to Ali, those narrated by Aisha count among the least favored.  Shia Islam also permits muttah - fixed-term temporary marriage - which is now banned by the Sunnis.  Muttah was originally permitted at the time of the Prophet (pbuh) and is now being promoted in Iran by an unlikely alliance of conservative clerics and feminists, the latter group seeking to downplay the obsession with female virginity which is prevalent in both forms of Islam, pointing out that only one of the Prophet's thirteen wives was a virgin when he married them.  Shias Today Iran is overwhelmingly Shia - 89{\%}. Shias also form a majority of the population in Yemen and Azerbaijan, Bahrain and 60{\%} of the population of Iraq. There are also sizeable Shia communities along the east coast of Saudi Arabia and in the Lebanon.  The well known guerilla organization Hizbollah, which forced the Israelis out of southern Lebanon in 2000, is Shia.  Worldwide, Shias constitute ten to fifteen percent of the overall Muslim population.  Within Shia Islam there are different sects.  Most Shias are "Twelvers", i.e. they recognize the 12 Imams. There are also Sevener and Fiver Shias who don't recognize the later Imams.  Please find below a commentary from a Shia encyclopaedia concerning Sheikh Shaltoot's fatwa plus the English translation of the fatwa itself. Both were originally posted on the One Ummah site where the original Arabic version of the fatwa is also available.  At the very bottom of this page, you will find what I understand to be a complete statement of Shia beliefs. },

In addition, Russia's wavering between Chinese and Western economic models is a real-world replay of two heated theoretical debates: first, between shock therapists and those who favor more gradual economic transformations; and second, between those who believe that economic reform best precedes political reform and those who argue that the sequencing of reforms matters little. It is argued that, although Russia's economic reforms will have to progress more slowly than shock therapists would prefer, adopting the Chinese model does not present a viable "third way" for Russian economic reformers. This conclusion is based upon an analysis of Russia's unique political situation, economic constraints, and the effects of its attempt to move towards democracy and the market simultaneously.},

abstract = {In this thesis we will investigate type theory with identity types, which was invented by Per Martin-Lof in the 1970's. While the theory of identity types was originally intended to internalize the notion of equality in type theory, and thereby enableing one to prove equality of two terms by inhabiting the corresponding identity types, it has become apparent in the last decade that it provides a setting for doing formal homotopy theory. The main idea was to interpret a proof of equality for two terms a and b as a path from a to b. The pioneers of this interpretation were Steve Awodey, Michael Warren and Vladimir Voevodsky and the theory that resulted from their work is currently intensively investigated, both from it's type theoretical side and by providing new models for the theory. This thesis could be seen as a report on the recent type theoretical results in this program},

Commonly used RAD algorithms such as backpropagation, however, are complex and stateful, hindering deep understanding, improvement, and parallel execution. This paper develops a simple, generalized AD algorithm calculated from a simple, natural specification. The general algorithm is then specialized by varying the representation of derivatives. In particular, applying well-known constructions to a naive representation yields two RAD algorithms that are far simpler than previously known. In contrast to commonly used RAD implementations, the algorithms defined here involve no graphs, tapes, variables, partial derivatives, or mutation. They are inherently parallel-friendly, correct by construction, and usable directly from an existing programming language with no need for new data types or programming style, thanks to use of an AD-agnostic compiler plugin.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The participants represented two groups: financial analysts and laypeople (people without knowledge or skills in finance). All participants were asked to forecast future stock market performance and foreign exchange rates. Additionally, they marked their confidence on a 100-point scale. The results showed that the forecasts significantly differed from the real values. In forecasting both the stock market and the currency exchange market, the prediction error significantly differed from zero. Even if the participants were optimistic in making the directional stock market forecasts, they were pessimistic when making point index predictions, which suggests a judgmental paradox. The experts were slightly better than the non-experts in predicting the stock market. However, their accuracy was generally not better in the exchange market forecasts. The next step of the analysis focused on the confidence factor. The results of this part of the research showed that the laypeople were less confident than the experts in all the judgments.},

This requires the mobilization of resources and the maintenance of political will for implementation of immediate peace-related needs such as the reintegration of excombatants into civil society and the strengthening of democratic institutions. Long-run policy objectives must encompass not only the attainment of macroeconomic balances, but also equity, that is, balance in the distribution of income and wealth; balanced investment in human, natural, and physical capital; and democratization in the broad sense of a more balanced distribution of power. In the end, policies which fail to build on the crucial complementarities between peace and development are unlikely to achieve either goal.},

abstract = {This short introduction to category theory is for readers with relatively little mathematical background. At its heart is the concept of a universal property, important throughout mathematics. After a chapter introducing the basic definitions, separate chapters present three ways of expressing universal properties: via adjoint functors, representable functors, and limits. A final chapter ties the three together. For each new categorical concept, a generous supply of examples is provided, taken from different parts of mathematics. At points where the leap in abstraction is particularly great (such as the Yoneda lemma), the reader will find careful and extensive explanations.},

China′s gradualism is the product of political deadlock over the final form of the economy. China has been most successful in the areas where reforms have been radical and lackluster where reforms have been incremental. The output performance across reforming countries reflected differences mainly in economic structures rather than in policies. China′s growth comes from the movement of surplus agricultural labor into industry, and Poland′s and Russia′s decline come from the closing of noncompetitive enterprises to release factors of production to the new efficient enterprises.

Keynes noted that. if the system's exogenous rate of population and real growth was halved. the need for ‘widening of capital' to keep the same per capita capital intensity would thereby drop by one-half - leading to a big increase in the average percentage unemployment if there were no change in the propensity to consume. Here the historical Keynes-Hansen-Samuelson multiplier-accelerator model is aug- mented by incorporating a life-cycle savings model. Interestingly, although the life cycle effects do reduce quantitatively the stagnation effects of population decline. they do not negate the qualitative intuitions of Hansen and Keynes.},

The book has a two-pronged message: first, that the second law is not infinitely incomprehensible as commonly stated in most textbooks on thermodynamics, but can, in fact, be comprehended through sheer common sense; and second, that entropy is not a mysterious quantity that has resisted understanding but a simple, familiar and easily comprehensible concept. Written in an accessible style, the book guides the reader through an abundance of dice games and examples from everyday life. The author paves the way for readers to discover for themselves what entropy is, how it changes, and, most importantly, why it always changes in one direction in a spontaneous process. In this new edition, seven simulated games are included so that the reader can actually experiment with the games described in the book. These simulated games are meant to enhance the readers' understanding and sense of joy upon discovering the Second Law of Thermodynamics.},

abstract = {The Gutenberg invention of printing has been a major precondition for the development of present-day science and the science system. With this historical analogue as a starting point, the article addresses the present and future impact of the emergence of electronic communication networks as epitomized by the Internet and the World Wide Web on the future organization and operation of the science system, including political science and the effects that can already be found in the science system. The analysis finds that the impact of electronic communication is already strongly felt in the "hard" sciences, but much less so in the humanities and social sciences, although its potential there is also large. Electronic communication is a field where the social sciences should engage much more in research than is presently done. /// L'invention de l'imprimerie par Gutenberg fut une condition pr{\'{e}}alable au d{\'{e}}veloppement du syst{\`{e}}me scientifique contemporain.

abstract = {The aim of this thesis is to present a mathematical framework for conceptualizing and constructing adaptive autonomous systems under resource constraints. The first part of this thesis contains a concise presentation of the foundations of classical agency: namely the formalizations of decision making and learning. Decision making includes: (a) subjective expected utility (SEU) theory, the framework of decision making under uncertainty; (b) the maximum SEU principle to choose the optimal solution; and (c) its application to the design of autonomous systems, culminating in the Bellman optimality equations. Learning includes: (a) Bayesian probability theory, the theory for reasoning under uncertainty that extends logic; and (b) Bayes-Optimal agents, the application of Bayesian probability theory to the design of optimal adaptive agents. Then, two major problems of the maximum SEU principle are highlighted: (a) the prohibitive computational costs and (b) the need for the causal precedence of the choice of the policy. The second part of this thesis tackles the two aforementioned problems. First, an information-theoretic notion of resources in autonomous systems is established. Second, a framework for resource-bounded agency is introduced. This includes: (a) a maximum bounded SEU principle that is derived from a set of axioms of utility; (b) an axiomatic model of probabilistic causality, which is applied for the formalization of autonomous systems having uncertainty over their policy and environment; and (c) the Bayesian control rule, which is derived from the maximum bounded SEU principle and the model of causality, implementing a stochastic adaptive control law that deals with the case where autonomous agents are uncertain about their policy and environment.},

@article{Millidge2020,
abstract = {Backpropagation of error (backprop) is a powerful algorithm for training machine learning architectures through end-to-end differentiation. However, backprop is often criticised for lacking biological plausibility. Recently, it has been shown that backprop in multilayer-perceptrons (MLPs) can be approximated using predictive coding, a biologically-plausible process theory of cortical computation which relies only on local and Hebbian updates. The power of backprop, however, lies not in its instantiation in MLPs, but rather in the concept of automatic differentiation which allows for the optimisation of any differentiable program expressed as a computation graph. Here, we demonstrate that predictive coding converges asymptotically (and in practice rapidly) to exact backprop gradients on arbitrary computation graphs using only local learning rules. We apply this result to develop a straightforward strategy to translate core machine learning architectures into their predictive coding equivalents. We construct predictive coding CNNs, RNNs, and the more complex LSTMs, which include a non-layer-like branching internal graph structure and multiplicative interactions. Our models perform equivalently to backprop on challenging machine learning benchmarks, while utilising only local and (mostly) Hebbian plasticity. Our method raises the potential that standard machine learning algorithms could in principle be directly implemented in neural circuitry, and may also contribute to the development of completely distributed neuromorphic architectures. .},

abstract = {Agents are systems that optimize an objective function in an environment. Together, the goal and the environment induce secondary objectives, incentives. Modeling the agent-environment interaction using causal influence diagrams, we can answer two fundamental questions about an agent's incentives directly from the graph: (1) which nodes can the agent have an incentivize to observe, and (2) which nodes can the agent have an incentivize to control? The answers tell us which information and influence points need extra protection. For example, we may want a classifier for job applications to not use the ethnicity of the candidate, and a reinforcement learning agent not to take direct control of its reward mechanism. Different algorithms and training paradigms can lead to different causal influence diagrams, so our method can be used to identify algorithms with problematic incentives and help in designing algorithms with better incentives.},

This is a welcome development. Yet it is also pertinent to point to some limitations of the prevailing social movement theories (those grounded in the technologically advanced and politically open societies) to account for the complexities of sociopolitical activism in contemporary Muslim societies, which are often characterised by political control and limited means for communicative action. The article argues for a more fluid and fragmented understanding of social movements, which may better explain the differentiated and changing disposition of such movements as Islamism. In this context, I propose the concept of 'imagined solidarities', which might help illustrate modes of solidarity building in such closed political settings as the contemporary Muslim Middle East.},

Our approach beats the imitation learning baseline in 7 games and achieves strictly superhuman performance on 2 games without using game rewards. Additionally, we investigate the goodness of fit of the reward model, present some reward hacking problems, and study the effects of noise in the human labels.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

Achieving such flexibility in artificial systems is challenging, even with more and more computational power. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that abstraction and hierarchical information processing might in fact be the consequence of limitations in information-processing power. In particular, we study an information-theoretic framework of bounded rational decision-making that trades off utility maximization against information-processing costs. We apply the basic principle of this framework to perception-action systems with multiple information-processing nodes and derive bounded-optimal solutions. We show how the formation of abstractions and decision-making hierarchies depends on information-processing costs. We illustrate the theoretical ideas with example simulations and conclude by formalizing a mathematically unifying optimization principle that could potentially be extended to more complex systems.},

abstract = {We propose a theory of information expressed solely in terms of which transformations of physical systems are possible and which are impossible - i.e. in constructor-theoretic terms. It includes conjectured, exact laws of physics expressing the regularities that allow information to be physically instantiated. Although these laws are directly about information, independently of the details of particular physical instantiations, information is not regarded as an a priori mathematical or logical concept, but as something whose nature and properties are determined by the laws of physics alone. This theory solves a problem at the foundations of existing information theory, namely that information and distinguishability are each defined in terms of the other. It also explains the relationship between classical and quantum information, and reveals the single, constructor-theoretic property underlying the most distinctive phenomena associated with the latter, including the lack of in-principle distinguishability of some states, the impossibility of cloning, the existence of pairs of variables that cannot simultaneously have sharp values, the fact that measurement processes can be both deterministic and unpredictable, the irreducible perturbation caused by measurement, and locally inaccessible information (as in entangled systems).},

abstract = {When running an experiment, precision is essential to ensure results are as exact as possible. Thus, computers, which offer endless accuracy, have become an inevitable tool to design experiments. To avoid programming from scratch for each new situation, a program, E-Prime, has been created to ease the conception of experiments. E-Prime, developed by PSTNet, offers a user-friendly interface that makes typical experiments easy to create. This paper shows how to effortlessly create an experiment with E-Prime, followed by a simple example.},

"Illustrative examples treated in some detail include: Bass-Serre Theory, Coxeter groups, Thompson groups, Whitehead's contractible 3-manifold, Davis's exotic contractible manifolds in dimensions greater than three, the Bestvina-Brady Theorem, and the Bieri-Neumann-Strebel invariant.

abstract = {Complex adaptive systems (cas), including ecosystems, governments, biological cells, and markets, are characterized by intricate hierarchical arrangements of boundaries and signals. In ecosystems, for example, niches act as semi-permeable boundaries, and smells and visual patterns serve as signals; governments have departmental hierarchies with memoranda acting as signals; and so it is with other cas. Despite a wealth of data and descriptions concerning different cas, there remain many unanswered questions about "steering" these systems. In Signals and Boundaries, John Holland argues that understanding the origin of the intricate signal/border hierarchies of these systems is the key to answering such questions. He develops an overarching framework for comparing and steering cas through the mechanisms that generate their signal/boundary hierarchies.Holland lays out a path for developing the framework that emphasizes agents, niches, theory, and mathematical models. He discusses, among other topics, theory construction; signal-processing agents; networks as representations of signal/boundary interaction; adaptation; recombination and reproduction; the use of tagged urn models (adapted from elementary probability theory) to represent boundary hierarchies; finitely generated systems as a way to tie the models examined into a single framework; the framework itself, illustrated by a simple finitely generated version of the development of a multi-celled organism; and Markov processes.},

While the theory of identity types was originally intended to internalize the notion of equality in type theory, and thereby enableing one to prove equality of two terms by inhabiting the corresponding identity types, it has become apparent in the last decade that it provides a setting for doing formal homotopy theory. The main idea was to interpret a proof of equality for two terms a and b as a path from a to b. The pioneers of this interpretation were Steve Awodey, Michael Warren and Vladimir Voevodsky and the theory that resulted from their work is currently intensively investigated, both from it's type theoretical side and by providing new models for the theory. This thesis could be seen as a report on the recent type theoretical results in this program},

The provision of a grace period increased short-run business investment and long-run profits but also default rates. The results, thus, indicate that debt contracts that require early repayment discourage illiquid risky investment and thereby limit the potential impact of microfinance on microenterprise growth and household poverty.},

We propose a reconciliation between these two perspectives, building on related work in philosophy. After laying out a taxonomy of different variants of each view, we observe that (i) although political phenomena result from underlying individual attitudes and behavior, individual-level descriptions do not always capture all explanatorily salient properties, and (ii) nonreductionistic explanations are mandated when social regularities are robust to changes in their individual-level realization. We characterize the dividing line between phenomena requiring nonreductionistic explanation and phenomena permitting individualistic explanation and give examples from the study of ethnic conflicts, social-network theory, and international-relations theory.},

It consists of choosing an appropriate information gathering mechanism, the learning protocol, and exploring the class of concepts that can be learned using it in a reasonable (polynomial) number of steps. Although inherent algorithmic complexity appears to set serious limits to the range of concepts that can be learned, we show that there are some important nontrivial classes of propositional concepts that can be learned in a realistic sense.},

Neither the standard Keynesian policies of decades past nor the monetary policy doctrine of recent years provides useful solutions. Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium theory is part of the crisis wreckage, but turning to old or to New Keynesian theory will be of little use. A balance sheet recession requires that policy address the problems in the private sector's capital as well as its income accounts. We need serious theoretical work on problems of system stability using, for example, agent-based methods. Monetary theory needs to develop analysis of processes in which intertemporal budget constraints are violated. Network theory will be useful in that quest.},

abstract = {This paper considers the relationship between thermodynamics, information and inference. In particular, it explores the thermodynamic concomitants of belief updating, under a variational (free energy) principle for self-organization. In brief, any (weakly mixing) random dynamical system that possesses a Markov blanket—i.e. a separation of internal and external states—is equipped with an information geometry. This means that internal states parametrize a probability density over external states. Furthermore, at non-equilibrium steady-state, the flow of internal states can be construed as a gradient flow on a quantity known in statistics as Bayesian model evidence. In short, there is a natural Bayesian mechanics for any system that possesses a Markov blanket. Crucially, this means that there is an explicit link between the inference performed by internal states and their energetics—as characterized by their stochastic thermodynamics.},

A dazzling array of applications of Reynolds' theory exists, exploiting invariance to yield "free theorems", non-inhabitation results, and encodings of algebraic datatypes. Outside computer science, invariance is a common theme running through many areas of mathematics and physics. For example, the area of a triangle is unaltered by rotation or flipping. If we scale a triangle, then we scale its area, maintaining an invariant relationship between the two. The transformations under which properties are invariant are often organised into groups, with the algebraic structure reflecting the composability and invertibility of transformations. In this paper, we investigate programming languages whose types are indexed by algebraic structures such as groups of geometric transformations. Other examples include types indexed by principals-for information flow security-and types indexed by distances-for analysis of analytic uniform continuity properties. Following Reynolds, we prove a general Abstraction Theorem that covers all these instances. Consequences of our Abstraction Theorem include free theorems expressing invariance properties of programs, type isomorphisms based on invariance properties, and non-definability results indicating when certain algebraically indexed types are uninhabited or only inhabited by trivial programs. We have fully formalised our framework and most examples in Coq. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {Perfectly rational decision-makers maximize expected utility, but crucially ignore the resource costs incurred when determining optimal actions. Here we employ an axiomatic framework for bounded rational decision-making based on a thermodynamic interpretation of resource costs as information costs. This leads to a variational "free utility" principle akin to thermodynamical free energy that trades off utility and information costs. We show that bounded optimal control solutions can be derived from this variational principle, which leads in general to stochastic policies. Furthermore, we show that risk-sensitive and robust (minimax) control schemes fall out naturally from this framework if the environment is considered as a bounded rational and perfectly rational opponent, respectively. When resource costs are ignored, the maximum expected utility principle is recovered. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The study of type systems for programming languages now touches many areas of computer science, from language design and implementation to software engineering, network security, databases, and analysis of concurrent and distributed systems. This book offers accessible introductions to key ideas in the field, with contributions by experts on each topic. The topics covered include precise type analyses, which extend simple type systems to give them a better grip on the run time behavior of systems; type systems for low-level languages; applications of types to reasoning about computer programs; type theory as a framework for the design of sophisticated module systems; and advanced techniques in ML-style type inference. Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages builds on Benjamin Pierce's Types and Programming Languages (MIT Press, 2002); most of the chapters should be accessible to readers familiar with basic notations and techniques of operational semantics and type systems — the material covered in the first half of the earlier book. Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages can be used in the classroom and as a resource for professionals. Most chapters include exercises, ranging in difficulty from quick comprehension checks to challenging extensions, many with solutions.},

Many theories of value imply that even relatively small reductions in net existential risk have enormous expected value. Despite their importance, issues surrounding human-extinction risks and related hazards remain poorly understood. In this article, I clarify the concept of existential risk and develop an improved classification scheme. I discuss the relation between existential risks and basic issues in axiology, and show how existential risk reduction (via the maxipok rule) can serve as a strongly action-guiding principle for utilitarian concerns. I also show how the notion of existential risk suggests a new way of thinking about the ideal of sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2013 University of Durham and John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

This situation becomes typical to new Internet economies, where agent technologies play a major role. This allows the definition of a program equilibrium . Following the fundamental ideas introduced by von Neumann in the 1940s (in parallel to his seminal contribution to game theory), a computer program can be used both as a set of instructions, as well as a file that can be read and compared with other files. We show that this idea implies that in a program equilibrium of the one-shot prisoners dilemma mutual cooperation is obtained. More generally, we show that the set of program equilibrium payoffs of a game coincides with the set of feasible and individually rational payoffs of it. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Around the world, publics confronted with terrorism have debated whether Islamic faith gives rise to a uniquely virulent strain of non-state violence targeted at civilians. These discussions almost always conceive of "Islam" in general terms, not clearly defining what is meant by Islamic religious faith. We engaged this debate by designing and conducting a large-scale public opinion survey in Pakistan that measures multiple elements of religiosity, allowing us to separately consider the relationship between support for militant organizations and (1) religious practice; (2) support for political Islam; and (3) "jihadism," which we define as a particular textual interpretation common to Islamist groups espousing violent political action. We also measured support for militant organizations using a novel form of an "endorsement experiment" that assessed attitudes toward specific groups without asking respondents about them directly. We find that neither religious practice nor support for political Islam is related to support for militant groups. However, Pakistanis who believe jihad is both an external militarized struggle and that it can be waged by individuals are more supportive of violent groups than those who believe it is an internal struggle for righteousness.},

abstract = {The second law of thermodynamics is probabilistic in nature. Its formulation requires that the state of a system be described by a probability distribution. A natural question, thereby, arises as to whether a prior knowledge about the state of the system affects the second law. This question has now been nurtured over a century and its inception was done by C. Maxwell through his famous thought experiment wherein comes the idea of Maxwell's demon. The next important step in this direction was provided by L. Szilard who demonstrated a theoretical model for an information engine incorporating Maxwell's demon. The final step that lead to the inter-linkage between information theory and thermodynamics was through Landauer's principle of information erasure that established the fact that information is physical. Here we will present an overview of these three major works that laid the foundations of information thermodynamics.},

abstract = {Agents are systems that optimize an objective function in an environment. Together, the goal and the environment induce secondary objectives, incentives. Modeling the agent-environment interaction in graphical models called influence diagrams, we can answer two fundamental questions about an agent's incentives directly from the graph: (1) which nodes is the agent incentivized to observe, and (2) which nodes is the agent incentivized to influence? The answers tell us which information and influence points need extra protection. For example, we may want a classifier for job applications to not use the ethnicity of the candidate, and a reinforcement learning agent not to take direct control of its reward mechanism. Different algorithms and training paradigms can lead to different influence diagrams, so our method can be used to identify algorithms with problematic incentives and help in designing algorithms with better incentives.},

abstract = {Automatic differentiation (AD) in reverse mode (RAD) is a central component of deep learning and other uses of large-scale optimization. Commonly used RAD algorithms such as backpropagation, however, are complex and stateful, hindering deep understanding, improvement, and parallel execution. This paper develops a simple, generalized AD algorithm calculated from a simple, natural specification. The general algorithm is then specialized by varying the representation of derivatives. In particular, applying well-known constructions to a naive representation yields two RAD algorithms that are far simpler than previously known. In contrast to commonly used RAD implementations, the algorithms defined here involve no graphs, tapes, variables, partial derivatives, or mutation. They are inherently parallel-friendly, correct by construction, and usable directly from an existing programming language with no need for new data types or programming style, thanks to use of an AD-agnostic compiler plugin.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of mobile phone text messaging and that of traditional health worker training in communicating clinical recommendations to health workers in China. METHODS: A cluster-randomized controlled trial (Chinese Clinical Trial Register: ChiCTR-TRC-09000488) was conducted in 100 township health centres in north-western China between 17 October and 25 December 2011. Health workers were allocated either to receive 16 text messages with recommendations on the management of viral infections affecting the upper respiratory tract and otitis media (intervention group, n = 490) or to receive the same recommendations through the existing continuing medical education programme - a one-day training workshop (control group, n = 487). Health workers' knowledge of the recommendations was assessed before and after messaging and traditional training through a multiple choice questionnaire. The percentage change in score in the control group was compared with that in the intervention group. Changes in prescribing practices were also compared. FINDINGS: Health workers' knowledge of the recommendations increased significantly in the intervention group, both individually (0.17 points; 95{\%} confidence interval, CI: 0.168-0.172) and at the cluster level (0.16 points; 95{\%} CI: 0.157-0.163), but not in the control group. In the intervention group steroid prescriptions decreased by 5 percentage points but antibiotic prescriptions remained unchanged. In the control group, however, antibiotic and steroid prescriptions increased by 17 and 11 percentage points, respectively. CONCLUSION: Text messages can be effective for transmitting medical information and changing health workers' behaviour, particularly in resource-limited settings.

The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.},

@article{Canetti2010,
abstract = {The association between religion and violence has raised much interest in both academic and public circles. Yet on the individual level, existing empirical accounts are both sparse and conflicting. Based on previous research which found that religion plays a role in the support of political violence only through the mediation of objective and perceived deprivations, the authors test Conservation of Resource (COR) theory as an individual level explanation for the association of religion, socio-economic deprivations, and support for political violence. COR theory predicts that when individuals' personal, social or economic resources are threatened, a response mechanism may include violence. Utilizing two distinct datasets, and relying on structural equation models analysis, the latter two stages of a three-stage study are reported here. In a follow-up to their previous article, the authors refine the use of socio-economic variables in examining the effects of deprivation as mediating between religion and political violence. Then, they analyze an independent sample of 545 Muslims and Jews, collected during August and September 2004, to test a psychological-based explanation based on COR theory. This study replaces measures of deprivation used in the previous stages with measures of economic and psychological resource loss. Findings show that the relationship between religion and support of political violence only holds true when mediated by deprivations and psychological resource loss. They also suggest that the typical tendency to focus on economic resource loss is over-simplistic as psychological, not economic, resources seem to mediate between religion and support of violence.},

abstract = {Machine learning is currently involved in some of the most vigorous debates it has ever seen. Such debates often seem to go around in circles, reaching no conclusion or resolution. This is perhaps unsurprising given that researchers in machine learning come to these discussions with very different frames of reference, making it challenging for them to align perspectives and find common ground. As a remedy for this dilemma, we advocate for the adoption of a common conceptual framework which can be used to understand, analyze, and discuss research. We present one such framework which is popular in cognitive science and neuroscience and which we believe has great utility in machine learning as well: Marr's levels of analysis. Through a series of case studies, we demonstrate how the levels facilitate an understanding and dissection of several methods from machine learning. By adopting the levels of analysis in one's own work, we argue that researchers can be better equipped to engage in the debates necessary to drive forward progress in our field.},

abstract = {This study critically analyses the information-theoretic, axiomatic and combinatorial philosophical bases of the entropy and cross-entropy concepts. The combinatorial basis is shown to be the most fundamental (most primitive) of these three bases, since it gives (i) a derivation for the Kullback-Leibler cross-entropy and Shannon entropy functions, as simplified forms of the multinomial distribution subject to the Stirling approximation; (ii) an explanation for the need to maximize entropy (or minimize cross-entropy) to find the most probable realization; and (iii) new, generalized definitions of entropy and cross-entropy - supersets of the Boltzmann principle - applicable to non-multinomial systems. The combinatorial basis is therefore of much broader scope, with far greater power of application, than the information-theoretic and axiomatic bases. The generalized definitions underpin a new discipline of ``{\{}$\backslash$it combinatorial information theory{\}}'', for the analysis of probabilistic systems of any type. Jaynes' generic formulation of statistical mechanics for multinomial systems is re-examined in light of the combinatorial approach. (abbreviated abstract)},

abstract = {In Esping-Andersen's influential work decommodification appears as the central characteristic of the welfare state, and efforts to decommodify labour are posited to be the main goal of social democracy. Since decommodification is defined as exit from the labour market with little or no loss of income, social democrats' emphasis on decommodification clashes with another purported goal of social democracy, high labour force participation. Drawing on research demonstrating the divergent employment effects of various decommodifying social policies, we resolve the existing paradox by showing that social democratic parties are supportive of decommodifying social policies insofar as these policies do not reduce aggregate levels of employment. Pooled time series analysis of employment-impeding policies (long-term unemployment replacement rate, social security and payroll taxes, and employment protection) suggests that they are associated with Christian democracy rather than social democracy. Instead, we find that social democracy is a key determinant of employment-friendly policies, such as active labour market spending and short-term unemployment replacement rate. Given the radically divergent employment effects of different types of decommodifying social policies and the importance of employment-friendly policies for the viability of generous welfare states, our analysis further underlines the future viability of the social democratic model.},

@article{Floreano2015,
abstract = {D rones, a popular nickname for unmanned aerial vehicles and micro aerial vehicles, often conjure up images of unmanned aeroplanes that fly thousands of miles for espionage and to deploy munitions. However, over the past few years, an increasing number of public and private research laboratories have been working on small, human-friendly drones that one day may autonomously fly in confined spaces and in close proximity to people. The development of these small drones, which is the main focus of this Review, has been supported by the miniaturization and cost reduction of electronic components (micro-processors, sensors, batteries and wireless communication units), largely driven by the portable electronic device industry. These improvements have enabled the prototyping and commercialization of small (typically less than 1 kg) drones at smartphone prices. Small drones will have important socioeconomic impacts (Fig. 1). Images from drones that are capable of flying a few metres above the ground will fill a gap between expensive, weather-dependent and low-resolution images provided by satellites and car-based images limited to human-level perspectives and the availability of accessible roads. Specialized flying cameras and cloud-based data analytics will allow farmers to continuously monitor the quality of crop growth. Such platforms will enable construction companies to measure work progress in real time. Drones will let mining companies obtain precise volumetric data of excavations. Energy and infrastructure companies will be able to exhaustively survey pipelines, roads and cables. Humanitarian organizations could immediately assess and adapt aid efforts in continuously changing refugee camps. Transportation drones that are capable of safely taking off and landing in the proximity of buildings and humans will allow developing countries-without a suitable road network-to rapidly deliver goods and to finally unleash the full potential of their e-commerce telecommu-nication infrastructure. Transportation drones will also help developed countries to improve the quality of service in congested or remote areas, and will enable rescue organizations to quickly deliver medical supplies in the field and on demand. Inspection drones that are capable of flying in confined spaces will help fire-fighting and emergency units to assess dangers faster and more safely, logistic companies to detect cracks in the inner and outer shells of ships, road maintenance companies to measure signs of wear and tear in bridges and tunnels, security companies to improve building safety by monitoring areas outside the range of surveillance cameras, and disaster mitigation agencies to inspect partially collapsed buildings where ground clutter is an obstacle for terrestrial robots. Coordinated teams of autonomous drones will enable missions that last longer than the flight time of a single drone by allowing some drones to temporarily leave the team for battery replacement. Drone teams will permit rescue organizations to quickly deploy dedicated communication networks for ground operators. Telecommunication companies can also leverage drone networks to temporarily supplement or replace points of service. Realizing this vision will require new mechatronic solutions and new levels of control autonomy (Box 1) to safely complete missions in confined spaces and near the ground, where absolute positioning signals and remote control are not available or sufficiently precise. None of today's commercial drones has sufficient control autonomy to complete any of the missions described without skilled human supervision, which makes those operations slow, dangerous and not scalable. We identify the most promising scientific and technological advances that could lead to a new generation of small autonomous drones and offer a tentative road map of capability deployment within suitable regulatory frameworks. Design and manufacturing challenges Flight is energetically expensive, particularly when the size of the device is reduced. This is often due to practical issues that arise when scaling a vehicle down, such as reduced power density of electromagnetic motors, decreased transmission efficiency owing to increased dominance of friction from gears and bearings, and greater viscous losses because of reduced Reynolds numbers. Certain flight modes are also challenging-for example, hovering-either owing to energetics or control; these also become increasingly difficult as size is reduced. Scaling issues create problems at the most basic level of autonomy: they limit the ability to simply sustain flight for an adequate amount of time to perform higher-level mission functions. To overcome these challenges, developers of drones must consider system-level design choices that balance trade-offs that arise when selecting the constituent components to power the vehicle. The most common morphologies for flying robots include more conventional fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft (rotorcraft) designs as well as bio-inspired designs based on flapping wings. Each of these platform types has pros and cons. For example, fixed-wing aircraft (Fig. 2a) are capable of fast and efficient flight, but typically cannot hover. Rotorcraft (Fig. 2b) can hover and are highly manoeuvrable, but are generally less efficient in forward flight than fixed-wing vehicles. Neither fixed-wing We are witnessing the advent of a new era of robots-drones-that can autonomously fly in natural and man-made environments. These robots, often associated with defence applications, could have a major impact on civilian tasks, including transportation, communication, agriculture, disaster mitigation and environment preservation. Autonomous flight in confined spaces presents great scientific and technical challenges owing to the energetic cost of staying airborne and to the perceptual intelligence required to negotiate complex environments. We identify scientific and technological advances that are expected to translate, within appropriate regulatory frameworks, into pervasive use of autonomous drones for civilian applications.},

@article{Aghion2011,
abstract = {Sanford Grossman and Oliver Hart used the theory of incomplete contracts to develop answers to the question ''What is a firm, and what determines its boundaries??'' in their path-breaking paper on ''The Costs and Benefits of Ownership: A Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration'' ( Journal of Political Economy, 1986, vol. 94, no. 4). Perhaps the central issue is that economic actors are only boundedly rational and cannot anticipate all possible contingencies. It might well be that certain states of nature or actions cannot be verified by third parties after they arise, like certain qualities of a good to be traded in the future, and thus cannot be written into an enforceable contract. When contracts are incomplete, and consequently not all uses of an asset can be specified in advance, any contract negotiated in advance must leave some discretion over the use of the assets; and the ''owner'' of the firm is the party to whom the residual rights of control have been allocated at the contracting stage. The optimal allocation of property rights--or governance structure--is one that minimizes efficiency losses. This produces a theory of ownership and vertical integration as well as a theory of the firm. First we spell out Grossman and Hart's argument using a simple numerical example. Then we show how the incomplete contracts approach can be used to analyze the firms' internal organization; the firms' financial decisions; the costs and benefits from privatization; and the organization of international trade between inter- and intrafirm trade. We discuss several criticisms of the incomplete contracts/property rights methodology and review recent developments of the incomplete contracts approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Organizational design often focuses on structural alternatives such as matrix, decentraliza-tion, and divisionalization. However, control variables (e.g., reward structures, task character-istics, and information systems) offer a more flexible approach. The purpose of this paper is to explore these control variables for organizational design. This is accomplished by integration and testing of two perspectives, organization theory and economics, notably agency theory. The resulting hypotheses link task characteristics, information systems, and business uncer-tainty to behavior vs. outcome based control strategy. These hypothesized linkages are examined empirically in a field study of the compensation practices for retail salespeople in 54 stores. The findings are that task programmability is strongly related to the choice of compensation package. The amount of behavioral measurement, the cost of measuring outcomes, and the uncertainty of the business also affect compensation. The findings have management implications for the design of compensation and reward packages, performance evaluation systems, and control systems, in general. Such systems should explicitly consider the task, the information system in place to measure performance, and the riskiness of the business. More programmed tasks require behavior based controls while less programmed tasks require more elaborate information systems or outcome based controls.},

The model allows interesting comparisons among the different economies related to the compositions of the national baskets. Synthetic solutions can also be used to estimate hidden and unexploited growth potentials. These prerogatives are strictly connected with the fact that a network structure is at the basis of the model. Such a network expresses the mutual influences of different products through resource transfers, and is a key ingredient producing cooperative growth effects which can be quantified and distinguished from those generated by deterministic drifts and representing direct resource inputs. An analysis of this network, which differs substantially from those previously considered within the economic complexity approach, allows to estimate the centrality of different products in each national basket, highlighting the most essential commodities for each economy. Solutions of the model give the possibility of performing counterfactual analyses aimed at estimating how much the growth of each country could have profited from a general strengthening, or weakening, of the links in the same products network.},

abstract = {Intelligent creatures can explore their environments and learn useful skills without supervision. In this paper, we propose “Diversity is All You Need”(DIAYN), a method for learning useful skills without a reward function. Our proposed method learns skills by maximizing an information theoretic objective using a maximum entropy policy. On a variety of simulated robotic tasks, we show that this simple objective results in the unsupervised emergence of diverse skills, such as walking and jumping. In a number of reinforcement learning benchmark environments, our method is able to learn a skill that solves the benchmark task despite never receiving the true task reward. We show how pretrained skills can provide a good parameter initialization for downstream tasks, and can be composed hierarchically to solve complex, sparse reward tasks. Our results suggest that unsupervised discovery of skills can serve as an effective pretraining mechanism for overcoming challenges of exploration and data efficiency in reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {The Gibbs entropy of a macroscopic classical system is a function of a probability distribution over phase space, i.e., of an ensemble. In contrast, the Boltzmann entropy is a function on phase space, and is thus defined for an individual system. Our aim is to discuss and compare these two notions of entropy, along with the associated ensemblist and individualist views of thermal equilibrium. Using the Gibbsian ensembles for the computation of the Gibbs entropy, the two notions yield the same (leading order) values for the entropy of a macroscopic system in thermal equilibrium. The two approaches do not, however, necessarily agree for non-equilibrium systems. For those, we argue that the Boltzmann entropy is the one that corresponds to thermodynamic entropy, in particular in connection with the second law of thermodynamics. Moreover, we describe the quantum analog of the Boltzmann entropy, and we argue that the individualist (Boltzmannian) concept of equilibrium is supported by the recent works on thermalization of closed quantum systems.},

Recent advances in the field of perception, planning, and decision-making for autonomous vehicles have led to great improvements in functional capabilities, with several prototypes already driving on our roads and streets. Yet challenges remain regarding guaranteed performance and safety under all driving circumstances. For instance, planning methods that provide safe and system-compliant performance in complex, cluttered environments while modeling the uncertain interaction with other traffic participants are required. Furthermore , new paradigms, such as interactive planning and end-to-end learning, open up questions regarding safety and reliability that need to be addressed. In this survey, we emphasize recent approaches for integrated perception and planning and for behavior-aware planning, many of which rely on machine learning. This raises the question of verification and safety, which we also touch upon. Finally, we discuss the state of the art and remaining challenges for managing fleets of autonomous vehicles.},

abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

abstract = {The move from hand-designed features to learned features in machine learning has been wildly successful. In spite of this, optimization algorithms are still designed by hand. In this paper we show how the design of an optimization algorithm can be cast as a learning problem, allowing the algorithm to learn to exploit structure in the problems of interest in an automatic way. Our learned algorithms, implemented by LSTMs, outperform generic, hand-designed competitors on the tasks for which they are trained, and also generalize well to new tasks with similar structure. We demonstrate this on a number of tasks, including simple convex problems, training neural networks, and styling images with neural art.},

abstract = {A new theory is taking hold in neuroscience. The theory is increasingly being used to interpret and drive experimental and theoretical studies, and it is finding its way into many other domains of research on the mind. It is the theory that the brain is a sophisticated hypothesis-testing mechanism, which is constantly involved in minimizing the error of its predictions of the sensory input it receives from the world. This mechanism is meant to explain percep- tion and action and everything mental in between. It is an attractive theory because powerful theoretical arguments support it. It is also attractive because more and more empirical evidence is beginning to point in its favour. It has enormous unifying power and yet it can explain in detail too. This book explores this theory. It explains how the theory works and how it applies; it sets out why the theory is attractive; and it shows why and how the central ideas behind the theory profoundly change how we should conceive of perception, action, attention, and other central aspects of the mind.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Both, a first-law like energy balance involving exchanged heat and entropy production entering refinements of the second law can consistently be defined along single stochastic trajectories. Various exact relations involving the distribution of such quantities like integral and detailed fluctuation theorems for total entropy production and the Jarzynski relation follow from such an approach based on Langevin dynamics. Analogues of these relations can be proven for any system obeying a stochastic master equation like, in particular, (bio)chemically driven enzyms or whole reaction networks. The perspective of investigating such relations for stochastic field equations like the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation is sketched as well. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer.},

abstract = {When considering sectarian relations in Iraq, we are invariably presented with images of either ecumenical harmony that reduce sectarian identity in Iraqi history to an historical side-note, or of perennial hatreds perpetually seeking an opportunity to manifest themselves in violence or separation. Neither view is satisfactory and both are based on reductions and generalisations that are perhaps inevitable when so complex a subject is reduced to a handful of paragraphs in broader Iraq-focussed works. The first step to understanding sectarian identity in Iraq is to treat it is a group identity rather than a religious or political identity. Secondly, to avoid generalisations and reductions, it is necessary to identify the drivers of sectarian relations and sectarian identity and to understand the social factors that animate sectarian identity (here considerations of class and geography are essential). Thirdly, the relationship between sectarian identity and national identity has been sorely misunderstood and commentators have tended to treat the two as mutually antagonistic forms of identity. Finally and perhaps most importantly, is the question of salience: there is no such thing as a fixed and perpetually salient identity. The theoretical arguments outlined in chapters 2 and 3 will be used in the remainder of the study to focus on two major turning points in Iraqi sectarian relations: the uprising in southern Iraq of March 1991 (and more importantly the contentious memory of the uprisings) and the fall of the Ba'ath in 2003. Chapters 4-6 deal with the events of 1991, the subsequent sanctions-era and the competing mythologies of the uprisings while chapters 7 and 8 examine the post-2003 era, the politicisation of sectarian identities and, perhaps consequently, the sectarian civil war of 2006-2007. With regards to sectarian relations, I would argue that no other episode in modern Iraqi history have had as polarised a memory as these two events.},

abstract = {A basic proposition is that the greater the uncertainty of the task, the greater the amount of information that has to be processed between decision makers during the execution of the task. If the task is well understood prior to performing it, much of the activity can be preplanned. If it is not under stood, then during the actual task execution more knowledge is acquired which leads to changes in resource allocations, schedules, and priorities. All these changes require information processing during task performance. There fore the greater the task uncertainty, the greater the amount of information that must be processed among decision makers during task execution in order to achieve a given level of performance. The basic effect of uncertainty is to limit the ability of the organization to preplan or to make decisions about activities in advance of their execution. Therefore it is hypothesized that the observed variations in organizational forms are variations in the strategies of organizations to 1) increase their ability to preplan, 2) increase their flexibility to adapt to their inability to preplan, or, 3) to decrease the level of performance required for continued viability. Which strategy is chosen depends on the relative costs of the strategies. The function of the framework is to identify these strategies and their costs.},

abstract = {The perception-action cycle is often defined as “the circular flow of information between an organismand its environment in the course of a sensory guided sequence of actions towards a goal” (Fuster 2001, 2006). The question we address in this paper is in what sense this “flow of information” can be described by Shannon's measures of information introduced in his mathematical theory of communication. We provide an affirmative answer to this question using an intriguing analogy between Shannon's classical model of communication and the Perception-Action-Cycle. In particular, decision and action sequences turn out to be directly analogous to codes in communication, and their complexity — the minimal number of (binary) decisions required for reaching a goal — directly bounded by information measures, as in communication. This analogy allows us to extend the standard Reinforcement Learning framework. The latter considers the future expected reward in the course of a behaviour sequence towards a goal (value-to-go). Here, we additionally incorporate a measure of information associated with this sequence: the cumulated information processing cost or bandwidth required to specify the future decision and action sequence (information-to-go). Using a graphical model, we derive a recursive Bellman optimality equation for information measures, in analogy to Reinforcement Learning; from this, we obtain new algorithms for calculating the optimal trade-off between the value-to-go and the required information-to-go, unifying the ideas behind the Bellman and the Blahut-Arimoto iterations. This trade-off between value-to-go and information-togo provides a complete analogy with the compression-distortion trade-off in source coding. The present new formulation connects seemingly unrelated optimization problems. The algorithm is demonstrated on grid world examples.},

A recurring issue in statistical physics is how best to approximate joint probability distributions with decoupled (and therefore far more tractable) distributions. This paper shows that the same information theoretic mathematical structure, known as Product Distribution (PD) theory, addresses both issues. In this, PD theory not only provides a principled formulation of bounded rationality and a set of new types of mean field theory in statistical physics. It also shows that those topics are fundamentally one and the same. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer.},

abstract = {Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is a promising approach to extend traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods to solve more complex tasks. Yet, the majority of current HRL methods require careful task-specific design and on-policy training, making them difficult to apply in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we study how we can develop HRL algorithms that are general, in that they do not make onerous additional assumptions beyond standard RL algorithms, and efficient, in the sense that they can be used with modest numbers of interaction samples, making them suitable for real-world problems such as robotic control. For generality, we develop a scheme where lower-level controllers are supervised with goals that are learned and proposed automatically by the higher-level controllers. To address efficiency, we propose to use off-policy experience for both higher- and lower-level training. This poses a considerable challenge, since changes to the lower-level behaviors change the action space for the higher-level policy, and we introduce an off-policy correction to remedy this challenge. This allows us to take advantage of recent advances in off-policy model-free RL to learn both higher- and lower-level policies using substantially fewer environment interactions than on-policy algorithms. We term the resulting HRL agent HIRO and find that it is generally applicable and highly sample-efficient. Our experiments show that HIRO can be used to learn highly complex behaviors for simulated robots, such as pushing objects and utilizing them to reach target locations,1 learning from only a few million samples, equivalent to a few days of real-time interaction. In comparisons with a number of prior HRL methods, we find that our approach substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques2},

In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology: namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a "cobordism". Similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept of "closed symmetric monoidal category".

However, internal conflict has not been reconciled with evolutionary principles, in that it appears maladaptive relative to a seamless decision-making process.

We find that, under natural physiological limitations, an optimal decision-making system can involve "selfish" agents that are in conflict with one another, even though the system is designed for a single purpose. It follows that conflict can emerge within a collective even when natural selection acts on the level of the collective only. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in modeling planning with information constraints. Accordingly, an agent maximizes a regularized expected utility known as the free energy, where the regularizer is given by the information divergence from a prior to a posterior policy. While this approach can be justified in various ways, including from statistical mechanics and information theory, it is still unclear how it relates to decisionmaking against adversarial environments. This connection has previously been suggested in work relating the free energy to risk-sensitive control and to extensive form games. Here, we show that a single-agent free energy optimization is equivalent to a game between the agent and an imaginary adversary. The adversary can, by paying an exponential penalty, generate costs that diminish the decision maker's payoffs. It turns out that the optimal strategy of the adversary consists in choosing costs so as to render the decision maker indifferent among its choices, which is a definining property of a Nash equilibrium, thus tightening the connection between free energy optimization and game theory..},

We propose Iterated Amplification, an alternative training strategy which progressively builds up a training signal for difficult problems by combining solutions to easier subproblems. Iterated Amplification is closely related to Expert Iteration (Anthony et al., 2017; Silver et al., 2017), except that it uses no external reward function.

The solution offered here applies to both in equal measure, and is based on the concept of particle indistinguishability (in the classical case, Gibbs' notion of 'generic phase'). Correctly understood, it is the elimination of sequence position as a labelling device, where sequences enter at the level of the tensor (or Cartesian) product of one-particle state spaces. In both cases it amounts to passing to the quotient space under permutations. 'Distinguishability', in the sense in which it is usually used in classical statistical mechanics, is a mathematically convenient, but physically muddled, fiction.},

When it is costly to list all specific rights over assets in the contract, it may be optimal to let one party purchase all residual rights. Ownership is the purchase of these residual rights. When residual rights are purchased by one party, they are lost by a second party, and this inevitably creates distortions. Firm 1 purchases firm 2 when firm l's control increases the productivity of its management more than the loss of control decreases the productivity of firm 2's management.},

abstract = {Abstract Crucial challenges for multiparty mediation processes include the achievement of adequate cooperation among the mediators and consequent coordination of their activities in the mediation process. Existing literature goes only as far as to make it clear that successful mediation requires necessary cooperation and coordination between mediators, as if these features were exogenous to the process. Available research does not consider whether these features might change over time and if such change could have an impact on the overall mediation process. Experience shows that it is not rare for mediators who were initially willing to pool their resources and act in concert with one another to decide at a later point to stop cooperating. Using a game theoretical model and a comparative analysis of three recent cases of multiparty mediation, this research illustrates the importance of maintaining necessary levels of cooperation and coordination to achieve successful outcomes and provides insights on how to achieve them in case the mediating coalition is faced with internal conflict of interests.},

abstract = {The traditional representations of games using the extensive form or the strategic (normal) form obscure much of the structure that is present in real-world games. In this paper, we propose a new representation language for general multi-player games - multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs). This representation extends graphical models for probability distributions to a multi-agent decision-making context. MAIDs explicitly encode structure involving the dependence relationships among variables. As a consequence, we can define a notion of strategic relevance of one decision variable to another: D′ is strategically relevant to D if, to optimize the decision rule at D, the decision maker needs to take into consideration the decision rule at D′. We provide a sound and complete graphical criterion for determining strategic relevance. We then show how strategic relevance can be used to detect structure in games, allowing a large game to be broken up into a set of interacting smaller games, which can be solved in sequence. We show that this decomposition can lead to substantial savings in the computational cost of finding Nash equilibria in these games.},

abstract = {Reynolds' theory of relational parametricity captures the invariance of polymorphically typed programs under change of data representation. Reynolds' original work exploited the typing discipline of the polymorphically typed $\lambda$-calculus System F, but there is now considerable interest in extending relational parametricity to type systems that are richer and more expressive than that of System F. This paper constructs parametric models of predicative and impredicative dependent type theory. The significance of our models is twofold. Firstly, in the impredicative variant we are able to deduce the existence of initial algebras for all indexed=functors. To our knowledge, ours is the first account of parametricity for dependent types that is able to lift the useful deduction of the existence of initial algebras in parametric models of System F to the dependently typed setting. Secondly, our models offer conceptual clarity by uniformly expressing relational parametricity for dependent types in terms of reflexive graphs, which allows us to unify the interpretations of types and kinds, instead of taking the relational interpretation of types as a primitive notion. Expressing our model in terms of reflexive graphs ensures that it has canonical choices for the interpretations of the standard type constructors of dependent type theory, except for the interpretation of the universe of small types, where we formulate a refined interpretation tailored for relational parametricity. Moreover, our reflexive graph model opens the door to generalisations of relational parametricity, for example to higher-dimensional relational parametricity. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

abstract = {Information Theory and Evolution discusses the phenomenon of life, including its origin and evolution (and also human cultural evolution), against the background of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and information theory. Among the central themes is the seeming contradiction between the second law of thermodynamics and the high degree of order and complexity produced by living systems. This paradox has its resolution in the information content of the Gibbs free energy that enters the biosphere from outside sources, as the author will show. The role of information in human cultural evolution is another focus of the book. The first edition of Information Theory and Evolution made a strong impact on thought in the field by bringing together results from many disciplines. The new second edition offers updated results based on reports of important new research in several areas, including exciting new studies of the human mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal DNA. Another extensive discussion featured in the second edition is contained in a new appendix devoted to the relationship of entropy and Gibbs free energy to economics. This appendix includes a review of the ideas of Alfred Lotka, Frederick Soddy, Nicholas Georgiescu-Roegen and Herman E. Daly, and discusses the relevance of these ideas to the current economic crisis. The new edition discusses current research on the origin of life, the distinction between thermodynamic information and cybernetic information, new DNA research and human prehistory, developments in current information technology, and the relationship between entropy and economics.},

abstract = {This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the concepts and idea of multisensor data fusion. It is an extensively revised second edition of the author's successful book: "Multi-Sensor Data Fusion: An Introduction" which was originally published by Springer-Verlag in 2007. The main changes in the new book are: New Material: Apart from one new chapter there are approximately 30 new sections, 50 new examples and 100 new references. At the same time, material which is out-of-date has been eliminated and the remaining text has been rewritten for added clarity. Altogether, the new book is nearly 70 pages longer than the original book. Matlab code: Where appropriate we have given details of Matlab code which may be downloaded from the worldwide web. In a few places, where such code is not readily available, we have included Matlab code in the body of the text. Layout. The layout and typography has been revised. Examples and Matlab code now appear on a gray background for easy identification and advancd material is marked with an asterisk. The book is intended to be self-contained. No previous knowledge of multi-sensor data fusion is assumed, although some familarity with the basic tools of linear algebra, calculus and simple probability is recommended. Although conceptually simple, the study of mult-sensor data fusion presents challenges that are unique within the education of the electrical engineer or computer scientist. To become competent in the field the student must become familiar with tools taken from a wide range of diverse subjects including: neural networks, signal processing, statistical estimation, tracking algorithms, computer vision and control theory. All too often, the student views multi-sensor data fusion as a miscellaneous assortment of different processes which bear no relationship to each other. In contrast, in this book the processes are unified by using a common statistical framework. As a consequence, the underlying pattern of relationships that exists between the different methodologies is made evident. The book is illustrated with many real-life examples taken from a diverse range of applications and contains an extensive list of modern references.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The common assumption is that corruption is bad for economic performance. So how can we explain the puzzling contrast between Russia and China? Is Russia being more severely "punished" for its corruption than China? If so, why? This article demonstrates that three intervening factors-comparative advantage, the organization of corruption, and the nature of rents-determines the impact of corruption on economic performance, and that these factors can explain the divergent outcomes. The article thereby offers an alternative to statist explanations of the Russia-China paradox. ?? 2006 The Regents of the University of California.},

@article{Wolpert2017,
abstract = {There are (at least) four ways that an agent can acquire information concerning the state of the universe: via observation, control, prediction, or via retrodiction, i.e., memory. Each of these four ways of acquiring information seems to rely on a different kind of physical device (resp., an observation device, a control device, etc.). However it turns out that certain mathematical structure is common to those four types of device. Any device that possesses a certain subset of that structure is known as an "inference device" (ID). Here I review some of the properties of IDs, including their relation with Turing machines, and (more loosely) quantum mechanics. I also review the bounds of the joint abilities of any set of IDs to know facts about the physical universe that contains them. These bounds constrain the possible properties of any universe that contains agents who can acquire information concerning that universe. I then extend this previous work on IDs, by adding to the definition of IDs some of the other mathematical structure that is common to the four ways of acquiring information about the universe but is not captured in the (minimal) definition of IDs. I discuss these extensions of IDs in the context of epistemic logic (especially possible worlds formalisms like Kripke structures and Aumann structures). In particular, I show that these extensions of IDs are not subject to the problem of logical omniscience that plagues many previously studied forms of epistemic logic.},

abstract = {Bounded rationality concerns the study of decision makers with limited information processing resources. Previously, the free energy difference functional has been suggested to model bounded rational decision making, as it provides a natural trade-off between an energy or utility function that is to be optimized and information processing costs that are measured by entropic search costs. The main question of this article is how the information-theoretic free energy model relates to simple $\epsilon$-optimality models of bounded rational decision making, where the decision maker is satisfied with any action in an $\epsilon$-neighborhood of the optimal utility. We find that the stochastic policies that optimize the free energy trade-off comply with the notion of $\epsilon$-optimality. Moreover, this optimality criterion even holds when the environment is adversarial. We conclude that the study of bounded rationality based on $\epsilon$-optimality criteria that abstract away from the particulars of the information processing constraints is compatible with the information-theoretic free energy model of bounded rationality.},

@article{Capraro2019,
abstract = {In the past few decades, numerous experiments have shown that humans do not always behave so as to maximize their material payoff. Cooperative behavior when noncooperation is a dominant strategy (with respect to the material payoffs) is particularly puzzling. Here we propose a novel approach to explain cooperation, assuming what Halpern and Pass call translucent players. Typically, players are assumed to be opaque, in the sense that a deviation by one player in a normal-form game does not affect the strategies used by other players. However, a player may believe that if he switches from one strategy to another, the fact that he chooses to switch may be visible to the other players. For example, if he chooses to defect in Prisoner's Dilemma, the other player may sense his guilt. We show that by assuming translucent players, we can recover many of the regularities observed in human behavior in well-studied games such as Prisoner's Dilemma, Traveler's Dilemma, Bertrand Competition, and the Public Goods game. The approach can also be extended to take into account a player's concerns that his social group (or God) may observe his actions. This extension helps explain prosocial behavior in situations in which previous models of social behavior fail to make correct predictions (e.g. conflict situations and situations where there is a trade-off between equity and efficiency).},

@article{Hoffman2015,
abstract = {Perception is a product of evolution. Our perceptual systems, like our limbs and livers, have been shaped by natural selection. The effects of selection on perception can be studied using evolutionary games and genetic algorithms. To this end, we define and classify perceptual strategies and allow them to compete in evolutionary games in a variety of worlds with a variety of fitness functions. We find that veridical perceptions—strategies tuned to the true structure of the world—are routinely dominated by nonveridical strategies tuned to fitness. Veridical perceptions escape extinction only if fitness varies monotonically with truth. Thus, a perceptual strategy favored by selection is best thought of not as a window on truth but as akin to a windows interface of a PC. Just as the color and shape of an icon for a text file do not entail that the text file itself has a color or shape, so also our perceptions of space-time and objects do not entail (by the Invention of Space-Time Theorem) that objective reality has the structure of space-time and objects. An interface serves to guide useful actions, not to resemble truth. Indeed, an interface hides the truth; for someone editing a paper or photo, seeing transistors and firmware is an irrelevant hindrance. For the perceptions of H. sapiens, space-time is the desktop and physical objects are the icons. Our perceptions of space-time and objects have been shaped by natural selection to hide the truth and guide adaptive behaviors. Perception is an adaptive interface.},

It guides us from simple inheritance, one of the most useful tools in the object-oriented programmer's toolbox, through exception handling to design patterns, an object-oriented way of looking at object-oriented concepts. Along the way, we'll learn how to integrate the object-oriented and the not-so-object- oriented aspects of the Python programming language. We will learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, emphasizing the difference between binary and textual data. We'll then cover the joys of unit testing, using not one, but two unit testing frameworks. Finally, we'll explore, through Python's various concurrency paradigms, how to make objects work well together at the same time. Each chapter includes relevant examples and a case study that collects the chapter's contents into a working (if not complete) program. This book specifically targets people who are new to object-oriented programming. It assumes you have basic Python skills. You'll learn object-oriented principles in depth. It is particularly useful for system administrators who have used Python as a glue language and would like to improve their programming skills. Alternatively, if you are familiar with object-oriented programming in other languages, then this book will help you understand the idiomatic ways to apply your knowledge in the Python ecosystem.},

abstract = {The free energy functional has recently been proposed as a variational principle for bounded rational decision-making, since it instantiates a natural trade-off between utility gains and information processing costs that can be axiomatically derived. Here we apply the free energy principle to general decision trees that include both adversarial and stochastic environments. We derive generalized sequential optimality equations that not only include the Bellman optimality equations as a limit case, but also lead to well-known decision-rules such as Expectimax, Minimax and Expectiminimax. We show how these decision-rules can be derived from a single free energy principle that assigns a resource parameter to each node in the decision tree. These resource parameters express a concrete computational cost that can be measured as the amount of samples that are needed from the distribution that belongs to each node. The free energy principle therefore provides the normative basis for generalized optimality equations that account for both adversarial and stochastic environments.},

@article{Johnson2013,
abstract = {Competition among firms has been suggested to reflect the ruthless logic of Darwinian selection: a free market is a struggle for survival, in which successful firms survive and unsuccessful ones die. This view appears to bolster three pillars of neoclassical economics: (1) that economic actors are self-interested; (2) that self-interest leads to public goods (Adam Smith's "invisible hand"); and (3) that together these lead to market optimization. However, this chain of reasoning leads to a paradox. We show that the application of Darwinian selection to competition among firms (as opposed to among individuals) invokes group selection, which leads to exactly the opposite predictions: notably altruism and the suppression of individual self-interest. We apply an alternative evolutionary model of economic competition, multi-level selection (MLS) theory, which integrates the effects of selection at both individual and group levels. This approach reveals that, while individuals may generally pursue their own self-interest (as in the standard evolutionary account), humans also have evolved traits that-as if led by an invisible hand-steer our self-interest to align with the good of the firm or wider society as well. But it is the hand of Darwin, not Smith. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

We argue that the separation of decision and risk-bearing functions observed in large corporations is common to other organizations such as large professional partnerships, financial mutuals, and nonprofits. We contend that separation of decision and risk-bearing functions survives in these organizations in part because of the benefits of specialization of management and risk bearing but also because of an effective common approach to controlling the agency problems caused by separation of decision and risk-bearing functions. In particular, our hypothesis is that the contract structures of all of these organizations separate the ratification and monitoring of decisions from initiation and implementa- tion of the decisions.},

Most analyses believe the the emerging postindustrial society is overdetermined by massive, convergent forces, such as tertiarization, new technologies, or globalization, all conspiring to make welfare states unsustainable in the future. Social Foundations of Postindustrial Economies takes a second, more sociological and more institutional, look at the driving forces of economic transformation. What, as a result, stands out is postindustrial diversity, not convergence. Macroscopic, global trends are undoubtedly powerful, yet their influence is easily rivalled by domestic institutional traditions, by the kind of welfare regime that, some generations ago, was put in place. It is, however, especially the family economy that hold the key as to what kind of postindustrial model will emerge, and to how evolving tradeoffs will be managed. Twentieth-century economic analysis depended on a set of sociological assumptions that, now, are invalid. Hence, to better grasp what drives today's economy, we must begin with its social foundations.},

Under these conditions, infor-mation maximisation has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The non-linearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the out-put representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalisation of Principal Components Analysis.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium model that is intended to help clarify the role of credit market frictions in business fluctuations, from both a qualitative and a quantitative standpoint. The model is a synthesis of the leading approaches in the literature. In particular, the framework exhibits a financial accelerator,' in that endogenous developments in credit markets work to amplify and propagate shocks to the macroeconomy. In addition, we add several features to the model that are designed to enhance the empirical relevance. First, we incorporate money and price stickiness, which allows us to study how credit market frictions may influence the transmission of monetary policy. In addition, we allow for lags in investment which enables the model to generate both hump-shaped output dynamics and a lead-lag relation between asset prices and investment, as is consistent with the data. Finally, we allow for heterogeneity among firms to capture the fact that borrowers have differential access to capital markets. Under reasonable parametrizations of the model, the financial accelerator has a significant influence on business cycle dynamics.},

abstract = {This paper shows that new loans to large borrowers fell by 47{\%} during the peak period of the financial crisis (fourth quarter of 2008) relative to the prior quarter and by 79{\%} relative to the peak of the credit boom (second quarter of 2007). New lending for real investment (such as working capital and capital expenditures) fell by only 14{\%} in the last quarter of 2008, but contracted nearly as much as new lending for restructuring (LBOs, M{\&}As, share repurchases) relative to the peak of the credit boom. After the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, there was a run by short-term bank creditors, making it difficult for banks to roll over their short term debt. We find that there was a simultaneous run by borrowers who drew down their credit lines, leading to a spike in commercial and industrial loans reported on bank balance sheets. We examine whether these two stresses on bank liquidity led them to cut lending. In particular, we show that banks cut their lending less if they had better access to deposit financing and thus, they were not as reliant on short-term debt. We also show that banks that were more vulnerable to credit-line drawdowns because they co-syndicated more of their credit lines with Lehman Brothers reduced their lending to a greater extent. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

Small adjustments at any one of these levels are unlikely to move the system away from its dominant, stable dynamic equilibrium. Governments, markets and communities are simultaneously weak in places characterized by fractal poverty traps. No unit operates at a high-level equilibrium in such a system.

This is work in progress toward showing that both categories embed faithfully and bijectively-on-objects into instances of a pattern we call categories of dioptics, whose name and definition both build heavily on [Ril18]. Using a generalization of the reverse-mode automatic differentiation functor of [Ell18] to arbitrary diffeological spaces with trivializable tangent bundles, we also construct a category of gradient-based learners which generalizes gradient-based learning beyond Euclidean parameter spaces. We aim to show that this category embeds naturally into the category of learners (with a choice of update rule and loss function), and that composing this embedding with reverse-mode automatic differentiation (and the inclusion of Euclidean spaces into trivializable diffeological spaces) recovers the backpropagation functor L of [FST18].},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

One might be concerned that such reversibility will make the second law of thermodynamics vulnerable to the designs of the demon of choice, a selective version of Maxwell's demon. The strategy of the demon of choice is to take advantage of rare fluctuations to extract useful work, and to reversibly undo measurements which do not lead to such a favorable but unlikely outcomes. I show that this threat does not arise as the demon of choice cannot operate without recording (explicitly or implicitly) whether its measurement was a success (or a failure). Thermodynamic cost associated with such a record cannot be, on the average, made smaller than the gain of useful work derived from the fluctuations.},

abstract = {This article focuses on the impact of scale economies on whether a market solution will yield the socially optimum kinds and quantities of commodities in welfare economics. This article develops some models to study various aspects of the relationship between market and optimal resource allocation in the presence of some nonconvexities. The monopoly power, which is a necessary ingredient of markets with nonconvexities, is usually considered to distort resources away from the sector concerned. However, in the analysis monopoly power enables firms to pay fixed costs, and entry cannot be prevented, so the relationship between monopoly power and the direction of market distortion is no longer obvious. In the central case of constant elasticity utility function, the market solution was constrained Pareto optimal, regardless of the value of that elasticity. With variable elasticities, the bias could go either way, and the direction of the bias depended not on how the elasticity of demand ch},

@article{Baez2012,
abstract = {Algorithmic entropy can be viewed as a special case of the entropy studied in statistical mechanics. This viewpoint allows us to apply many techniques developed for use in thermodynamics to the subject of algorithmic information theory. In particular, suppose we fix a universal prefix-free Turing machine and let X be the set of programs that halt for this machine. Then we can regard X as a set of 'microstates', and treat any function on X as an 'observable'. For any collection of observables, we can study the Gibbs ensemble that maximises entropy subject to constraints on the expected values of these observables. We illustrate this by taking the log runtime, length and output of a program as observables analogous to the energy E, volume V and number of molecules N in a container of gas. The conjugate variables of these observables allow us to define quantities we call the 'algorithmic temperature' T, 'algorithmic pressure' P and 'algorithmic potential' $\mu$, since they are analogous to the temperature, pressure and chemical potential. We derive an analogue of the fundamental thermodynamic relation dE = TdS - PdV + $\mu$dN, and use it to study thermodynamic cycles analogous to those for heat engines. We also investigate the values of T, P and $\mu$ for which the partition function converges. At some points on the boundary of this domain of convergence, the partition function becomes uncomputable - indeed, at these points the partition function itself has non-trivial algorithmic entropy. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2012.},

We first provide an overview of the incomplete contracting literature and explore parallels between this work and the problem of AI alignment. As we emphasize, misalignment between principal and agent is a core focus of economic analysis. We highlight some technical results from the economics literature on incomplete contracts that may provide insights for AI alignment researchers. Our core contribution, however, is to bring to bear an insight that economists have been urged to absorb from legal scholars and other behavioral scientists: the fact that human contracting is supported by substantial amounts of external structure, such as generally available institutions (culture, law) that can supply implied terms to fill the gaps in incomplete contracts. We propose a research agenda for AI alignment work that focuses on the problem of how to build AI that can replicate the human cognitive processes that connect individual incomplete contracts with this supporting external structure. },

In China the party-state has made possible the decentralization of property relations and the hardening of budget constraints whereas in Russia the disintegration of the party-state has led to privatization and soft budget constraints. Whereas the former combination entailed accumulation, the latter combination entailed "involution," that is, an economy that eats away at its own foundations by funnelling resources from production to exchange. Russia's involution has proceeded in a combined mode, that is, through a series of phases in which government policies try to rectify the unintended consequences of previous policies. Involution is also uneven as different industries adopt different strategies. Some rapidly exited from the old order and then disintegrated while others voiced their demands to the state and declined more slowly. Copyright ?? 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

I then recall Woronowicz' definition of compact quantum group and the notion of noncommutative principal bundle. When the structure group is U(1), there is a construction due to Pimsner that allows to get the total space of a "bundle" (more precisely, a strongly graded C*-algebra) from the base space and a noncommutative "line bundle" (a self-Morita equivalence bimodule). As an example of this construction, I will discuss the U(1)-principal bundles of quantum lens spaces over quantum weighted projective space. The second part is a peek into the realm of nonassociative geometry: after a review of some properties of Hopf cochains and cocycles, I will discuss the theory of cochain quantization and its applications, from Albuquerque-Majid example of octonions, to "line bundles" on the noncommutative torus.},

abstract = {A traditional assumption in game theory is that players are opaque to one another—if a player changes strategies, then this change in strategies does not affect the choice of other players' strategies. In many situations this is an unrealistic assumption. We develop a framework for reasoning about games where the players may be translucent to one another; in particular, a player may believe that if she were to change strategies, then the other player would also change strategies. Translucent players may achieve significantly more efficient outcomes than opaque ones. Our main result is a characterization of strategies consistent with appropriate analogues of common belief of rationality. Common Counterfactual Belief of Rationality (CCBR) holds if (1) everyone is rational, (2) everyone counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational (i.e., all players i believe that everyone else would still be rational even if i were to switch strategies), (3) everyone counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational, and counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational, and so on. CCBR characterizes the set of strategies surviving iterated removal of minimax-dominated strategies, where a strategy $\sigma$ for player i is minimax dominated by $\sigma$′ if the worst-case payoff for i using $\sigma$′ is better than the best possible payoff using $\sigma$.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Our evidence comes from public goods experiments that we conducted in 16 comparable participant pools around the world. However, there is a huge cross-societal variation. Some participant pools punished the high contributors as much as they punished the low contributors, whereas in others people only punished low contributors. In some participant pools, antisocial punishment was strong enough to remove the cooperation-enhancing effect of punishment. We also show that weak norms of civic cooperation and the weakness of the rule of law in a country are significant predictors of antisocial punishment. Our results show that punishment opportunities are socially beneficial only if complemented by strong social norms of cooperation.},

abstract = {Esping-Andersen's influential analysis of decommodification, and his depiction of three worlds of welfare capitalism, is rooted in the writings of Marx and Polanyi. However, whereas Esping-Andersen focuses on the way that commodification threatens the basic consumption needs of the labourer, Marx and Polanyi were equally concerned with its denial of the labourer's scope for self-development and critical social transformation. This paper first argues that even Esping-Andersen's analysis of decommodification in relation to consumption is flawed; it then proceeds to operationalise the notion of decommodification for self-development. Making use of the available cross-national data, the paper produces decommodification scores for a range of OECD countries which challenge the mapping inherited from Esping-Andersen, and which view welfare regimes in terms of their capacity to promote a creative, critical and highly skilled labour force. At the same time, it acknowledges that such composite indexes of decommodification depend on political value choices as to the overall priorities and organisation of society. The paper thus provides a new standpoint from which to analyse welfare regimes in relation to decommodification: one which gives a central place to education and vocational training, as forms of social investment.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are analyzed via the theoretical framework of the information bottleneck (IB) principle. We first show that any DNN can be quantified by the mutual information between the layers and the input and output variables. Using this representation we can calculate the optimal information theoretic limits of the DNN and obtain finite sample generalization bounds. The advantage of getting closer to the theoretical limit is quantifiable both by the generalization bound and by the network's simplicity. We argue that both the optimal architecture, number of layers and features/connections at each layer, are related to the bifurcation points of the information bottleneck tradeoff, namely, relevant compression of the input layer with respect to the output layer. The hierarchical representations at the layered network naturally correspond to the structural phase transitions along the information curve. We believe that this new insight can lead to new optimality bounds and deep learning algorithms.},

In this paper, we use an intuitive yet precise graphical model called causal influence diagrams to formalize reward tampering problems. We also describe a number of modifications to the reinforcement learning objective that prevent incentives for reward tampering. We verify the solutions using recently developed graphical criteria for inferring agent incentives from causal influence diagrams. Along the way, we also compare corrigibility and self-preservation properties of the various solutions, and discuss how they can be combined into a single agent without reward tampering incentives.},

abstract = {This paper describes a free energy principle that tries to explain the ability of biological systems to resist a natural tendency to disorder. It appeals to circular causality of the sort found in synergetic formulations of self-organization (e.g., the slaving principle) and models of coupled dynamical systems, using nonlinear Fokker Planck equations. Here, circular causality is induced by separating the states of a random dynamical system into external and internal states, where external states are subject to random fluctuations and internal states are not. This reduces the problem to finding some (deterministic) dynamics of the internal states that ensure the system visits a limited number of external states; in other words, the measure of its (random) attracting set, or the Shannon entropy of the external states is small. We motivate a solution using a principle of least action based on variational free energy (from statistical physics) and establish the conditions under which it is formally equivalent to the information bottleneck method. This approach has proved useful in understanding the functional architecture of the brain. The generality of variational free energy minimisation and corresponding information theoretic formulations may speak to interesting applications beyond the neurosciences; e.g., in molecular or evolutionary biology. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the authors.},

In each of two stages, a risk-neutral agent can choose an unobservable effort level. A success in the first stage makes effort in the second stage more effective. Should one agent be in control in both stages (integration), or should different agents be in charge of the two actions (separation)? Both modes of organization can be explained on the basis of incentive considerations due to moral hazard, without resorting to commitment problems or ad hoc restrictions on the class offeasible contracts.},

abstract = {In an increasing number of domains it has been demonstrated that deep learning models can be trained using relatively large batch sizes without sacrificing data efficiency. However the limits of this massive data parallelism seem to differ from domain to domain, ranging from batches of tens of thousands in ImageNet to batches of millions in RL agents that play the game Dota 2. To our knowledge there is limited conceptual understanding of why these limits to batch size differ or how we might choose the correct batch size in a new domain. In this paper, we demonstrate that a simple and easy-to-measure statistic called the gradient noise scale predicts the largest useful batch size across many domains and applications, including a number of supervised learning datasets (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, Billion Word), reinforcement learning domains (Atari and Dota), and even generative model training (autoencoders on SVHN). We find that the noise scale increases as the loss decreases over a training run and depends on the model size primarily through improved model performance. Our empirically-motivated theory also describes the tradeoff between compute-efficiency and time-efficiency, and provides a rough model of the benefits of adaptive batch-size training.},

Moreover, several major external assistance actors — notably the international financial institutions — have failed to exercise “peace conditionality”: they have not used formal performance criteria or informal policy dialogue to encourage the timely implementation of high-priority peace programs and the mobilization of greater domestic resources for this purpose. These institutions have recently broadened their mandates to encompass military expenditure reduction and good “governance.” While these concerns are particularly germane in countries emerging from civil war, the case of El Salvador demonstrates that they have yet to be fully incorporated into actual practice.},

First: we highlight a tight connection between variational option discovery methods and variational autoencoders, and introduce Variational Autoencoding Learning of Options by Reinforcement (VALOR), a new method derived from the connection. In VALOR, the policy encodes contexts from a noise distribution into trajectories, and the decoder recovers the contexts from the complete trajectories. Second: we propose a curriculum learning approach where the number of contexts seen by the agent increases whenever the agent's performance is strong enough (as measured by the decoder) on the current set of contexts. We show that this simple trick stabilizes training for VALOR and prior variational option discovery methods, allowing a single agent to learn many more modes of behavior than it could with a fixed context distribution. Finally, we investigate other topics related to variational option discovery, including fundamental limitations of the general approach and the applicability of learned options to downstream tasks.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

Inspired by Kurt Goedel's celebrated self-referential formulas (1931), such a problem solver rewrites any part of its own code as soon as it has found a proof that the rewrite is useful, where the problem-dependent utility function and the hardware and the entire initial code are described by axioms encoded in an initial proof searcher which is also part of the initial code. The searcher systematically and efficiently tests computable proof techniques (programs whose outputs are proofs) until it finds a provably useful, computable self-rewrite. We show that such a self-rewrite is globally optimal - no local maxima! - since the code first had to prove that it is not useful to continue the proof search for alternative self-rewrites. Unlike previous non-self-referential methods based on hardwired proof searchers, ours not only boasts an optimal order of complexity but can optimally reduce any slowdowns hidden by the O()-notation, provided the utility of such speed-ups is provable at all.},

The main idea was to interpret a proof of equality for two terms a and b as a path from a to b. The pioneers of this interpretation were Steve Awodey, Michael Warren and Vladimir Voevodsky and the theory that resulted from their work is currently intensively investigated, both from it's type theoretical side and by providing new models for the theory.

abstract = {Self-fertilization and apomixis have often been seen as alternative evolutionary strategies of flowering plants that are advantageous for colonization scenarios and in bottleneck situations. Both traits have multiple origins, but different genetic control mechanisms; possible connections between the two phenomena have long been overlooked. Most apomictic plants, however, need a fertilization of polar nuclei for normal seed development (pseudogamy). If self-pollen is used for this purpose, self-compatibility is a requirement for successful pollen tube growth. Apomictic lineages usually evolve from sexual self-incompatible outcrossing plants, but pseudogamous apomicts frequently show a breakdown of self-incompatibility. Two possible pathways may explain the evolution of SC: (1) Polyploidy not only may trigger gametophytic apomixis, but also may result in a partial breakdown of SI systems. (2) Alternatively, frequent pseudo self-compatibility (PSC) via aborted pollen may induce selfing of pseudogamous apomicts (mentor effects). Self-fertile pseudogamous genotypes will be selected for within mixed sexual-apomictic populations because of avoidance of interploidal crosses; in founder situations, SC provides reproductive assurance independent from pollinators and mating partners. SI pseudogamous genotypes will be selected against in mixed populations because of minority cytotype problems and high pollen discounting; in founder populations, SI reactions among clone mates will reduce seed set. Selection for SC genotypes will eliminate SI unless the apomict maintains a high genotypic diversity and thus a diversity of S-alleles within a population, or shifts to pollen-independent autonomous apomixis. The implications of a breakdown of SI in apomictic plants for evolutionary questions and for agricultural sciences are being discussed.},

abstract = {The field of artificial intelligence (AI) strives to build rational agents capable of perceiving the world around them and taking actions to advance specified goals. Put another way, AI researchers aim to construct a synthetic homo economicus, the mythical perfectly rational agent of neoclassical economics. We review progress toward creating this new species of machine, machina economicus, and discuss some challenges in designing AIs that can reason effectively in economic contexts. Supposing that AI succeeds in this quest, or at least comes close enough that it is useful to think about AIs in rationalistic terms, we ask how to design the rules of interaction in multi-agent systems that come to represent an economy of AIs.Theories of normative design from economics may prove more relevant for artificial agents than human agents, with AIs that better respect idealized assumptions of rationality than people, interacting through novel rules and incentive systems quite distinct from those tailored for people. E conomics models the behavior of people, firms, and other decision-makers as a means to understand how these decisions shape the pattern of activities that produce value and ultimately satisfy (or fail to satisfy) hu-man needs and desires. In this enterprise, the field classically starts from an assumption that actors behave rationally—that is, their decisions are the best possible given their available actions, their preferences, and their beliefs about the out-comes of these actions. Economics is drawn to rational decision models because they directly con-nect choices and values in a mathematically precise manner. Critics argue that the field studies a mythi-cal species, homo economicus (" economic man ") and produces theories with limited applicability to how real humans behave. Defenders acknowl-edge that rationality is an idealization but counter that the abstraction supports powerful analysis, which is often quite predictive of people's behav-ior (as individuals or in aggregate). Even if not perfectly accurate representations, rational models also allow preferences to be estimated from ob-served actions and build understanding that can usefully inform policy. Artificial intelligence (AI) research is likewise drawn to rationality concepts, because they pro-vide an ideal for the computational artifacts it seeks to create. Core to the modern conception of AI is the idea of designing agents: entities that perceive the world and act in it (1). The quality of an AI design is judged by how well the agent's actions advance specified goals, conditioned on the perceptions observed. This coherence among perceptions, actions, and goals is the essence of rationality. If we represent goals in terms of pref-erence over outcomes, and conceive perception and action within the framework of decision-making under uncertainty, then the AI agent's situation aligns squarely with the standard eco-nomic paradigm of rational choice. Thus, the AI designer's task is to build rational agents, or agents that best approximate rationality given the limits of their computational resources (2–4). In other words, AI strives to construct—out of silicon (or whatever) and information—a synthetic homo eco-nomicus, perhaps more accurately termed mach-ina economicus. The shared rationality abstraction provides a strong foundation for research that spans AI and economics. We start this review by describing pro-gress on the question of how to operationalize rationality and how to construct AI agents that are able to reason about other AIs. Supposing that AI research succeeds in developing an agent that can be usefully modeled as rational (perhaps},

abstract = {Maize yield increase has been strongly linked to plant population densities over time with changes in plant architecture, but the genetic basis for the plant architecture response to plant density is unknown, as is its stability across environments. To elucidate the genetic basis of the plant architecture response to density in maize, we mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for leaf morphology-related traits in four sets of recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations under two plant density conditions. Forty-five QTLs for six traits were detected in both high and low plant density conditions. Thirty-seven QTLs were only detected when grown under high plant density, and 34 QTLs were only detected when grown under low plant density. Twenty-two meta-QTLs (mQTLs) were identified by meta-analysis, and mQTL1-1, mQTL3-2 and mQTL8 were identified when grown under high and low plant densities, with R 2 of some initial QTLs [ 10 {\%}, suggesting the mQTLs might be hot spots of the important QTLs for the related traits under planting density stress conditions. The results pre-sented here provide useful information for further research and the marker-assisted selection of varieties targeting increased plant density and will help to reveal the molecular mechanisms related to leaf morphology in response to density.},

@article{Wolpert2019,
abstract = {One of the central concerns of computer science is how the resources needed to perform a given computation depend on that computation. Moreover, one of the major resource requirements of computers-ranging from biological cells to human brains to high-performance (engineered) computers-is the energy used to run them, i.e. the thermodynamic costs of running them. Those thermodynamic costs of performing a computation have been a longstanding focus of research in physics, going back (at least) to the early work of Landauer, in which he argued that the thermodynamic cost of erasing a bit in any physical system is at least kT ln[2]. One of the most prominent aspects of computers is that they are inherently non-equilibrium systems. However, the research by Landauer and co-workers was done when non-equilibrium statistical physics was still in its infancy, requiring them to rely on equilibrium statistical physics. This limited the breadth of issues this early research could address, leading them to focus on the number of times a bit is erased during a computation-an issue having little bearing on the central concerns of computer science theorists. Since then there have been major breakthroughs in nonequilibrium statistical physics, leading in particular to the new subfield of 'stochastic thermodynamics'. These breakthroughs have allowed us to put the thermodynamic analysis of bit erasure on a fully formal (nonequilibrium) footing. They are also allowing us to investigate the myriad aspects of the relationship between statistical physics and computation, extending well beyond the issue of how much work is required to erase a bit. In this paper I review some of this recent work on the 'stochastic thermodynamics of computation'. After reviewing the salient parts of information theory, computer science theory, and stochastic thermodynamics, I summarize what has been learned about the entropic costs of performing a broad range of computations, extending from bit erasure to loop-free circuits to logically reversible circuits to information ratchets to Turing machines. These results reveal new, challenging engineering problems for how to design computers to have minimal thermodynamic costs. They also allow us to start to combine computer science theory and stochastic thermodynamics at a foundational level, thereby expanding both.},

abstract = {Despite their great success, there is still no comprehensive theoretical understanding of learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) or their inner organization. Previous work proposed to analyze DNNs in the $\backslash$textit{\{}Information Plane{\}}; i.e., the plane of the Mutual Information values that each layer preserves on the input and output variables. They suggested that the goal of the network is to optimize the Information Bottleneck (IB) tradeoff between compression and prediction, successively, for each layer. In this work we follow up on this idea and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Information-Plane visualization of DNNs. Our main results are: (i) most of the training epochs in standard DL are spent on {\{}$\backslash$emph compression{\}} of the input to efficient representation and not on fitting the training labels. (ii) The representation compression phase begins when the training errors becomes small and the Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) epochs change from a fast drift to smaller training error into a stochastic relaxation, or random diffusion, constrained by the training error value. (iii) The converged layers lie on or very close to the Information Bottleneck (IB) theoretical bound, and the maps from the input to any hidden layer and from this hidden layer to the output satisfy the IB self-consistent equations. This generalization through noise mechanism is unique to Deep Neural Networks and absent in one layer networks. (iv) The training time is dramatically reduced when adding more hidden layers. Thus the main advantage of the hidden layers is computational. This can be explained by the reduced relaxation time, as this it scales super-linearly (exponentially for simple diffusion) with the information compression from the previous layer.},

For example, what can such deep networks compute? How can we train them? How does information propagate through them? Why can they generalize? And how can we teach them to imagine? We review recent work in which methods of physical analysis rooted in statistical mechanics have begun to provide conceptual insights into these questions. These insights yield connections between deep learning and diverse physical and mathematical topics, including random landscapes, spin glasses, jamming, dynamical phase transitions, chaos, Riemannian geometry, random matrix theory, free probability, and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Indeed, the fields of statistical mechanics and machine learning have long enjoyed a rich history of strongly coupled interactions, and recent advances at the intersection of statistical mechanics and deep learning suggest these interactions will only deepen going forward.},

This means that we must not only specify what to do, but also the much larger space of what not to do. It is easy to forget these preferences, since these preferences are already satisfied in our environment. This motivates our key insight: when a robot is deployed in an environment that humans act in, the state of the environment is already optimized for what humans want. We can therefore use this implicit preference information from the state to fill in the blanks. We develop an algorithm based on Maximum Causal Entropy IRL and use it to evaluate the idea in a suite of proof-of-concept environments designed to show its properties. We find that information from the initial state can be used to infer both side effects that should be avoided as well as preferences for how the environment should be organized.

We propose a formal definition of the value alignment problem as cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL). A CIRL problem is a cooperative, partial-information game with two agents, human and robot; both are rewarded according to the human's reward function, but the robot does not initially know what this is. In contrast to classical IRL, where the human is assumed to act optimally in isolation, optimal CIRL solutions produce behaviors such as active teaching, active learning, and communicative actions that are more effective in achieving value alignment. We show that computing optimal joint policies in CIRL games can be reduced to solving a POMDP, prove that optimality in isolation is suboptimal in CIRL, and derive an approximate CIRL algorithm.},

abstract = {Before the immense changes of the 2011 "Arab Spring", it was Sunni-Shia sectarian rivalry that preoccupied most political analyzes of the Middle East. The growing tensions and occasional clashes between believers in the two main strands of Islam have been major concerns. Upheavals within the Shia sphere of influence had altered the relationship: the Iranian revolution of 1979 changed the politics of Iranian Shiism, and impacted on Shia communities regionally, while the 2003 Anglo-American invasion of Iraq initiated a new phase of tension in Sunni-Shia relations. The specter of a sectarian war in Iraq, a diplomatic and military offensive against the Lebanese Hezbollah and a potentially nuclear-armed Iran (along with Tehran's support for Hamas) prompted King Abdallah II of Jordan to warn of an emerging 'Shia crescent'. However, away from such grand geopolitical gestures, Sunni-Shia relations are being rearticulated through an array of local, regional and global connections.  This book presents wide-ranging and up-to-date research that sheds light on the political, sociological and ideological processes that are affecting the dynamics within, as well as the relationships between, the Shia and Sunni worlds. Among the themes discussed are the ideological and doctrinal evolutions that are taking place, the contextualization of the main protagonists' political practices, transnational networks, and the role of intellectuals, religious scholars and the media in shaping and informing this dynamic relationship.},

Indeed, the heavy impairments of banks� balance$\backslash$nsheets brought to the fore the banking sector�s ability to$\backslash$nprovide a smooth flow of credit to the real economy. However,$\backslash$nmost existing structural macroeconomic models fail to take into$\backslash$naccount the crucial role of banks� balance sheet adjustment in$\backslash$nthe propagation of shocks to the economy. This paper contributes$\backslash$nto fill this gap, analyzing the role of credit market frictions$\backslash$nin business cycle fluctuations and in the transmission of$\backslash$nmonetary policy. We estimate a closed-economy dynamic stochastic$\backslash$ngeneral equilibrium (DSGE) model for the euro area with$\backslash$nfinancially-constrained households and firms and embedding an$\backslash$noligopolistic banking sector facing capital constraints. Using$\backslash$nthis setup we examine the macroeconomic implications of various$\backslash$nfinancial frictions on the supply and demand of credit, and in$\backslash$nparticular we assess the effects of introducing risk-sensitive$\backslash$nand more stringent capital requirements. Finally, we explore the$\backslash$nscope for counter-cyclical bank capital rules and the strategic$\backslash$ncomplementarities between macro-prudential tools and monetary$\backslash$npolicy},

We show that: (1) the Gibbs H function yields the correct entropy as defined in phenomenological thermodynamics; (2) the Boltzmann H yields an “entropy” that is in error by a nonnegligible amount whenever interparticle forces affect thermodynamic properties; (3) Boltzmann's other interpretation of entropy, S = k log W, is consistent with the Gibbs H, and derivable from it; (4) the Boltzmann H theorem does not constitute a demonstration of the second law for dilute gases; (5) the dynamical invariance of the Gibbs H gives a simple proof of the second law for arbitrary interparticle forces; (6) the second law is a special case of a general requirement for any macroscopic process to be experimentally reproducible. Finally, the “anthropomorphic” nature of entropy, on both the statistical and phenomenological levels, is stressed.},

abstract = {We define the relevant information in a signal {\$}x\backslashin X{\$} as being the information that this signal provides about another signal {\$}y\backslashin \backslashY{\$}. Examples include the information that face images provide about the names of the people portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words spoken. Understanding the signal {\$}x{\$} requires more than just predicting {\$}y{\$}, it also requires specifying which features of {\$}\backslashX{\$} play a role in the prediction. We formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for {\$}\backslashX{\$} that preserves the maximum information about {\$}\backslashY{\$}. That is, we squeeze the information that {\$}\backslashX{\$} provides about {\$}\backslashY{\$} through a `bottleneck' formed by a limited set of codewords {\$}\backslashtX{\$}. This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure {\$}d(x,\backslashx){\$} emerges from the joint statistics of {\$}\backslashX{\$} and {\$}\backslashY{\$}. This approach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules {\$}X \backslashto \backslashtX{\$} and {\$}\backslashtX \backslashto \backslashY{\$}. Solutions to these equations can be found by a convergent re-estimation method that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Our variational principle provides a surprisingly rich framework for discussing a variety of problems in signal processing and learning, as will be described in detail elsewhere.},

@article{Toffoli2016,
abstract = {Here we deconstruct, and then in a reasoned way reconstruct, the concept of "entropy of a system", paying particular attention to where the randomness may be coming from. We start with the core concept of entropy as a count associated with a description; this count (traditionally expressed in logarithmic form for a number of good reasons) is in essence the number of possibilities-specific instances or "scenarios"-that match that description. Very natural (and virtually inescapable) generalizations of the idea of description are the probability distribution and its quantum mechanical counterpart, the density operator. We track the process of dynamically updating entropy as a system evolves. Three factors may cause entropy to change: (1) the system's internal dynamics; (2) unsolicited external influences on it; and (3) the approximations one has to make when one tries to predict the system's future state. The latter task is usually hampered by hard-to-quantify aspects of the original description, limited data storage and processing resource, and possibly algorithmic inadequacy. Factors 2 and 3 introduce randomness-often huge amounts of it-into one's predictions and accordingly degrade them. When forecasting, as long as the entropy bookkeping is conducted in an honest fashion, this degradation will always lead to an entropy increase. To clarify the above point we introduce the notion of honest entropy, which coalesces much of what is of course already done, often tacitly, in responsible entropy-bookkeping practice. This notion-we believe-will help to fill an expressivity gap in scientific discourse. With its help, we shall prove that any dynamical system-not just our physical universe-strictly obeys Clausius's original formulation of the second law of thermodynamics if and only if it is invertible. Thus this law is a tautological property of invertible systems!},

@book{Khan2016,
abstract = {The subject of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is enormously complex, involving many concepts, probabilities, and signal processing that are woven together in an intricate manner. To cope with this scope and complexity, many DSP texts are often organized around the "numerical examples" of a communication system. With such organization, readers can see through the complexity of DSP, they learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the communication system while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together. From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such approach indeed works well. Based on the authors' extensive experience in teaching and research, Digital Signal Processing: a breadth-first approach is written with the reader in mind. The book is intended for a course on digital signal processing, for seniors and undergraduate students. The subject has high popularity in the field of electrical and computer engineering, and the authors consider all the needs and tools used in analysis and design of discrete time systems for signal processing. Key features of the book include: The extensive use of MATLAB based examples to illustrate how to solve signal processing problems. The textbook includes a wealth of problems, with solutions. Worked-out examples have been included to explain new and difficult concepts, which help to expose the reader to real-life signal processing problems. The inclusion of FIR and IIR filter design further enrich the contents.},

Humans tend to find the physical stance more helpful for certain systems, such as planets orbiting a star, and the intentional stance for others, such as living animals. We define a formal counterpart of physical and intentional stances within computational theory: a description of a system as either a device, or an agent, with the key difference being that `devices' are directly described in terms of an input-output mapping, while `agents' are described in terms of the function they optimise. Bayes' rule can then be applied to calculate the subjective probability of a system being a device or an agent, based only on its behaviour. We illustrate this using the trajectories of an object in a toy grid-world domain.},

We apply sparse grids to a global polynomial approximation of the model solution, to the quadrature of integrals arising as rational expectations, and to three new nonlinear state space filters which speed up the sequential importance resampling particle filter. The posterior of the structural parameters is estimated by a new Metropolis2013Hastings algorithm with mixing parallel sequences. The parallel extension improves the global maximization property of the algorithm, simplifies the parameterization for an appropriate acceptance ratio, and allows a simple implementation of the estimation on parallel computers. Finally, we provide all algorithms in the open source software JBendge for the solution and estimation of a general class of models.},

abstract = {A supervised learning algorithm searches over a set of functions A → B parametrised by a space P to find the best approximation to some ideal function f:A → B. It does this by taking examples (a, f(a)) ϵ A × B, and updating the parameter according to some rule. We define a category where these update rules may be composed, and show that gradient descent-with respect to a fixed step size and an error function satisfying a certain property-defines a monoidal functor from a category of parametrised functions to this category of update rules. A key contribution is the notion of request function. This provides a structural perspective on backpropagation, giving a broad generalisation of neural networks and linking it with structures from bidirectional programming and open games.},

This article characterizes all independence assertions that logically follow from the topology of a network and develops a linear time algorithm that identifies these assertions. The algorithm's correctness is based on the soundness of a graphical criterion, called d‐separation, and its optimality stems from the completeness of d‐separation. An enhanced version of d‐separation, called D‐separation, is defined, extending the algorithm to networks that encode functional dependencies. Finally, the algorithm is shown to work for a broad class of nonprobabilistic independencies. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1990 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company},

abstract = {Fills the Existing Gap of Mathematics for Data Fusion Data fusion (DF) combines large amounts of information from a variety of sources and fuses this data algorithmically, logically and, if required intelligently, using artificial intelligence (AI). Also, known as sensor data fusion (SDF), the DF fusion system is an important component for use in various applications that include the monitoring of vehicles, aerospace systems, large-scale structures, and large industrial automation plants. Data Fusion Mathematics: Theory and Practice offers a comprehensive overview of data fusion, and provides a proper and adequate understanding of the basic mathematics directly related to DF. The material covered can be used for evaluation of the performances of any designed and developed DF systems. It tries to answer whether unified data fusion mathematics can evolve from various disparate mathematical concepts, and highlights mathematics that can add credibility to the data fusion process. Focuses on Mathematical Tools That Use Data Fusion This text explores the use of statistical/probabilistic signal/image processing, filtering, component analysis, image algebra, decision making, and neuro-FL-GA paradigms in studying, developing and validating data fusion processes (DFP). It covers major mathematical expressions, and formulae and equations as well as, where feasible, their derivations. It also discusses SDF concepts, DF models and architectures, aspects and methods of type 1 and 2 fuzzy logics, and related practical applications. In addition, the author covers soft computing paradigms that are finding increasing applications in multisensory DF approaches and applications. This book: •Explores the use of interval type 2 fuzzy logic and ANFIS in DF •Covers the mathematical treatment of many types of filtering algorithms, target-tracking methods, and kinematic DF methods •Presents single and multi-sensor tracking and fusion mathematics •Considers specific DF architectures in the context of decentralized systems •Discusses information filtering, Bayesian approaches, several DF rules, image algebra and image fusion, decision fusion, and wireless sensor network (WSN) multimodality fusion Data Fusion Mathematics: Theory and Practice incorporates concepts, processes, methods, and approaches in data fusion that can help you with integrating DF mathematics and achieving higher levels of fusion activity, and clarity of performance. This text is geared toward researchers, scientists, teachers and practicing engineers interested and working in the multisensor data fusion area.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this article is twofold: to delineate a theory of transformative leadership, distinct from other theories (transformational or transactional leadership); and to assess the utility of the theory for guiding the practice of educational leaders who want to effect both educational and broader social change. Approach and Methods: This article is both conceptual and empirical. The delineation of transformative leadership theory is conceptual and draws on its historical and more recent theoretical roots. To investigate it empirically, the author identified two principals from a larger study and, using a backward mapping approach, attempted to determine, using Evers and Wu's (2006) abductive reasoning, whether transformative leadership might include "inference to the best explanation" (p. 518) for their practices. Participants, Data Collection, and Analysis: Using a set of predetermined criteria, the author selected two principals from a wider study of educators' pedagogical conceptions of social justice. The two were studied, using multiple interviews, confirmatory interviews with others, and observations in situ, to identify practices that might conform to categories of transformative leadership theory. Findings and Implications: Transformative leadership begins with questions of justice and democracy, critiques inequitable practices, and addresses both individual and public good. The author traced the practices of these principals to determine whether they were consistent with these and other elements of transformative leadership. She then considered alternate explanations and inferred from the data the best fit for transformative leadership, thus supporting its relevance for leadership for equity, deep democracy, and social justice.

The collected data were used to develop mathematical models that predict the formation of THM and HAA in terms of each of the studied factor: ClO2 dose, total organic content TOC, bromide ion concentration, pH, temperature and contact time. Mathematical models were developed for four trihalomethane species, as well as total trihalomethanes TTHM, in addition to six haloacetic acid species and total haloacetic acids THAA. Predicted THM and HAA concentrations using developed models were compared to actual concentrations measured in real samples. Results showed good correlation between measured and calculated values. This means that the method presented could be used to obtain good estimates of THM and HAA concentrations formed when the water is treated with ClO2 under different experimental conditions.},

Indifference techniques aim to achieve one or more of three distinct goals: rewards dependent on certain events (without the agent being motivated to manipulate the probability of those events), effective disbelief (where agents behave as if particular events could never happen), and seamless transition from one reward function to another (with the agent acting as if this change is unanticipated). This paper presents several methods for achieving these goals in the POMDP setting, establishing their uses, strengths, and requirements. These methods of control work even when the implications of the agent's reward are otherwise not fully understood.},

abstract = {This paper provides an easy to follow tutorial on the free-energy framework for modelling perception developed by Friston, which extends the predictive coding model of Rao and Ballard. These models assume that the sensory cortex infers the most likely values of attributes or features of sensory stimuli from the noisy inputs encoding the stimuli. Remarkably, these models describe how this inference could be implemented in a network of very simple computational elements, suggesting that this inference could be performed by biological networks of neurons. Furthermore, learning about the parameters describing the features and their uncertainty is implemented in these models by simple rules of synaptic plasticity based on Hebbian learning. This tutorial introduces the free-energy framework using very simple examples, and provides step-by-step derivations of the model. It also discusses in more detail how the model could be implemented in biological neural circuits. In particular, it presents an extended version of the model in which the neurons only sum their inputs, and synaptic plasticity only depends on activity of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons.},

abstract = {A problem-solving approach to statistical signal processing for practicing engineers, technicians, and graduate students. This book takes a pragmatic approach in solving a set of common problems engineers and technicians encounter when processing signals. In writing it, the author drew on his vast theoretical and practical experience in the field to provide a quick-solution manual for technicians and engineers, offering field-tested solutions to most problems engineers can encounter. At the same time, the book delineates the basic concepts and applied mathematics underlying each solution so that readers can go deeper into the theory to gain a better idea of the solution's limitations and potential pitfalls, and thus tailor the best solution for the specific engineering application. Uniquely, Statistical Signal Processing in Engineering can also function as a textbook for engineering graduates and post-graduates. Dr. Spagnolini, who has had a quarter of a century of experience teaching graduate-level courses in digital and statistical signal processing methods, provides a detailed axiomatic presentation of the conceptual and mathematical foundations of statistical signal processing that will challenge students' analytical skills and motivate them to develop new applications on their own, or better understand the motivation underlining the existing solutions. Throughout the book, some real-world examples demonstrate how powerful a tool statistical signal processing is in practice across a wide range of applications. •Takes an interdisciplinary approach, integrating basic concepts and tools for statistical signal processing. •Informed by its author's vast experience as both a practitioner and teacher. •Offers a hands-on approach to solving problems in statistical signal processing. •Covers a broad range of applications, including communication systems, machine learning, wavefield and array processing, remote sensing, image filtering and distributed computations. •Features numerous real-world examples from a wide range of applications showing the mathematical concepts involved in practice •Includes MATLAB code of many of the experiments in the book. Statistical Signal Processing in Engineering is an indispensable working resource for electrical engineers, especially those working in the information and communication technology (ICT) industry. It is also an ideal text for engineering students at large, applied mathematics post-graduates and advanced undergraduates in electrical engineering, applied statistics, and pure mathematics, studying statistical signal processing.},

abstract = {Many studies around the world have looked at the stresses placed on medical students by cadaveric dissection. Although these studies have linked the use of cadavers in medical teaching to stress, some investigations have suggested an association with severe psychological stress and even PTSD. This study assessed the attitudes of medical and biomedical sciences students in an Irish medical school towards cadaveric dissection by recording, through a questionnaire, their perceptions and experience before initial exposure to dissection and subsequently examining their attitudes after the first dissection and after 9 weeks. Student attitudes towards the dissecting room remained consistently positive for the duration of the study with only a minority of respondents reporting negative symptoms. Pre-existing attitudes to the idea of dissection were unaffected by exposure and subsequent continuous experience of dissection. The majority of students in this study did not find the dissecting room experience stressful, and considered time spent in the dissecting room valuable. However, the proportion of students with negative experiences in the dissecting room was higher than has been reported in previous studies. Many respondents felt they could be better prepared for the dissecting room experience, indicating an increasing requirement for effective preparatory programmes.

abstract = {The classical bias-variance trade-off predicts that bias decreases and variance increase with model complexity, leading to a U-shaped risk curve. Recent work calls this into question for neural networks and other over-parameterized models, for which it is often observed that larger models generalize better. We provide a simple explanation for this by measuring the bias and variance of neural networks: while the bias is monotonically decreasing as in the classical theory, the variance is unimodal or bell-shaped: it increases then decreases with the width of the network. We vary the network architecture, loss function, and choice of dataset and confirm that variance unimodality occurs robustly for all models we considered. The risk curve is the sum of the bias and variance curves and displays different qualitative shapes depending on the relative scale of bias and variance, with the double descent curve observed in recent literature as a special case. We corroborate these empirical results with a theoretical analysis of two-layer linear networks with random first layer. Finally, evaluation on out-of-distribution data shows that most of the drop in accuracy comes from increased bias while variance increases by a relatively small amount. Moreover, we find that deeper models decrease bias and increase variance for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.},

This paper analyzes the decisions of a hyperbolic consumer who has access to an imperfect commitment technology: an illiquid asset whose sale must be initiated one period before the sale proceeds are received. The model predicts that consumption tracks income, and the model explains why consumers have asset-specific marginal pro- pensities to consume. The model suggests that financial innovation may have caused the ongoing decline in U. S. savings rates, since financial innovation in- creases liquidity, eliminating commitment opportunities. Finally, the model im- plies that financial market innovation may reduce welfare by providing "too much" liquidity.},

abstract = {Informal lenders with access to markets or capital often find it attractive to delegate loan provision to downstream lenders who have an information or enforcement advantage in dealing with particular borrowers. In this paper we examine the conditions under which such an arrangement is preferred by two informal lenders, a landlord and a merchant, who compete in loan provision to tenant farmers differentiated by wealth. We show that credit layering is preferred only when tenants are sufficiently poor. In this case, the trader lends to tenant farmers via a contract with their landlord. Otherwise, only the trader lends. As a consequence, a pattern of borrowing emerges in which relatively wealthy tenants borrow from merchants while poor tenants borrow mainly from their landlords. Interlinkage between land and credit thus arises only for a subset of tenants and purely as a consequence of credit layering. This pattern is shown to be supported empirically. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In lucid and appealing prose, Polya reveals how the mathematical method of demonstrating a proof or finding an unknown can be of help in attacking any problem that can be "reasoned" out-from building a bridge to winning a game of anagrams. Generations of readers have relished Polya's deft-indeed, brilliant-instructions on stripping away irrelevancies and going straight to the heart of the problem. In this best-selling classic, George P{\'{o}}lya revealed how the mathematical method of demonstrating a proof or finding an unknown can be of help in attacking any problem that can be "reasoned" out-from building a bridge to winning a game of anagrams. Generations of readers have relished P{\'{o}}lya's deft instructions on stripping away irrelevancies and going straight to the heart of a problem. How to Solve It popularized heuristics, the art and science of discovery and invention. It has been in print continuously since 1945 and has been translated into twenty-three different languages. P{\'{o}}lya was one of the most influential mathematicians of the twentieth century. He made important contributions to a great variety of mathematical research: from complex analysis to mathematical physics, number theory, probability, geometry, astronomy, and combinatorics. He was also an extraordinary teacher-he taught until he was ninety-and maintained a strong interest in pedagogical matters throughout his long career. In addition to How to Solve It, he published a two-volume work on the topic of problem solving, Mathematics of Plausible Reasoning, also with Princeton. P{\'{o}}lya is one of the most frequently quoted mathematicians, and the following statements from How to Solve It make clear why: "My method to overcome a difficulty is to go around it." "Geometry is the science of correct reasoning on incorrect figures." "In order to solve this differential equation you look at it till a solution occurs to you."},

In this paper, we generalise this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.},

abstract = {For an autonomous system to be helpful to humans and to pose no unwarranted risks, it needs to align its values with those of the humans in its environment in such a way that its actions contribute to the maximization of value for the humans. We propose a formal definition of the value alignment problem as cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL). A CIRL problem is a cooperative, partial-information game with two agents, human and robot; both are rewarded according to the human's reward function, but the robot does not initially know what this is. In contrast to classical IRL, where the human is assumed to act optimally in isolation, optimal CIRL solutions produce behaviors such as active teaching, active learning, and communicative actions that are more effective in achieving value alignment. We show that computing optimal joint policies in CIRL games can be reduced to solving a POMDP, prove that optimality in isolation is suboptimal in CIRL, and derive an approximate CIRL algorithm.},

@book{Maiti1981a,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Intuition has been emphasized in the presentation to make the material accessible to the nontheoretician while still providing precise arguments for the specialist. This balance is the result of new proofs of established theorems, and new presentations of the standard proofs.The topics covered include the motivation, definitions, and fundamental results, both positive and negative, for the widely studied L. G. Valiant model of Probably Approximately Correct Learning; Occam's Razor, which formalizes a relationship between learning and data compression; the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension; the equivalence of weak and strong learning; efficient learning in the presence of noise by the method of statistical queries; relationships between learning and cryptography, and the resulting computational limitations on efficient learning; reducibility between learning problems; and algorithms for learning finite automata from active experimentation.},

The theory is illustrated by many real concrete examples taken from a host of disciplinary settings. The standard approach in decision theory or decision analysis specifies a simplified single objective like monetary return to maximise. By generalising from the single objective case to the multiple objective case, this book considerably widens the range of applicability of decision analysis.},

We have recently argued that the OS must provide time protection, in analogy to the established memory protection, to protect applications from information leakage through timing channels. Based on a recently-proposed implementation of time protection in the seL4 microkernel, we investigate how such an implementation could be formally proved to prevent timing channels. We postulate that this should be possible by reasoning about a highly abstracted representation of the shared hardware resources that cause timing channels.},

abstract = {Perfectly rational decision-makers maximize expected utility, but crucially ignore the resource costs incurred when determining optimal actions. Here, we propose a thermodynamically inspired formalization of bounded rational decision-making where information processing is modelled as state changes in thermodynamic systems that can be quantified by differences in free energy. By optimizing a free energy, bounded rational decision-makers trade off expected utility gains and information-processing costs measured by the relative entropy. As a result, the bounded rational decision-making problem can be rephrased in terms of well-known variational principles from statistical physics. In the limit when computational costs are ignored, the maximum expected utility principle is recovered. We discuss links to existing decision-making frameworks and applications to human decision-making experiments that are at odds with expected utility theory. Since most of the mathematical machinery can be borrowed from statistical physics, the main contribution is to reinterpret the formalism of thermodynamic free-energy differences in terms of bounded rational decisionmaking and to discuss its relationship to human decision-making experiments.

Typically, the parameters of the models are interpreted as effects that indicate the change in a dependent variable that would occur if one or more independent variables were set to values other than the values actually taken. The purpose of this article is to formally demonstrate, in a fashion accessible to the social researcher who is not a methodologist, why the interpretations above do not generally hold, even when the model is correctly specified and a causal theory is given. Some implications for the way in which social research is and should be conducted are discussed. In particular, the usual strategies for testing competing causal explanations are misdirected. Further, the emphasis on causation in contemporary sociology is often misdirected. {\textcopyright} 1996, SAGE PERIODICALS PRESS. All rights reserved.},

For each topic, basic concepts are introduced, examples are given, proofs of key results are offered, and algorithmic considerations are examined. An appendix covers background material in probability theory, classical logic, Markov decision processes and mathematical programming. Written by two of the leading researchers of this engaging field, this book will surely serve as THE reference for researchers in the fastest-growing area of computer science, and be used as a text for advanced undergraduate or graduate courses.},

abstract = {One obstacle to applying reinforcement learning algorithms to real-world problems is the lack of suitable reward functions. Designing such reward functions is difficult in part because the user only has an implicit understanding of the task objective. This gives rise to the agent alignment problem: how do we create agents that behave in accordance with the user's intentions? We outline a high-level research direction to solve the agent alignment problem centered around reward modeling: learning a reward function from interaction with the user and optimizing the learned reward function with reinforcement learning. We discuss the key challenges we expect to face when scaling reward modeling to complex and general domains, concrete approaches to mitigate these challenges, and ways to establish trust in the resulting agents.},

Beazley's {\textless}I{\textgreater}Python Essential Reference, Second Edition{\textless}/I{\textgreater} will serve as a capable and exceptionally competent guide to current Python syntax and library modules. Concise, yet authoritative, this book sets a high standard as a one-volume reference to this powerful object-oriented programming language.{\textless}p{\textgreater}   Although the author claims that this title is not really a tutorial, the first 100 pages actually provide an excellent guide to the basics of Python as a language. Geared especially to the experienced programmer seeking to see what's different (and potentially better) about Python, sections on the language itself will let you ramp up on the basic and advanced topics. Short sections with code excerpts that show off essential language features will help you learn or enhance your knowledge of Python quickly. Standout sections here include excellent coverage of object-oriented features, like "special methods" that will let you add custom classes to Python that are just as flexible as built-in classes.{\textless}p{\textgreater}   The heart of this book is the 250-page reference section. The author concentrates on all current Python modules (eschewing deprecated or obsolete APIs). Starting with basic modules for Python services and operating system functions, and including handling strings and math functions, the author explains and illustrates each module with short sample code, along with a full listing of APIs. Sections on Python's impressive support for virtually all networking protocols (including sockets, HTTP, FTP, and e-mail) are a standout and will arguably justify the cost of this title for many Python developers. Later modules look at undocumented functions, plus there's an in-depth guide to integrating Python and C code.

abstract = {To achieve general intelligence, agents must learn how to interact with others in a shared environment: this is the challenge of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). The simplest form is independent reinforcement learning (InRL), where each agent treats its experience as part of its (non-stationary) environment. In this paper, we first observe that policies learned using InRL can overfit to the other agents' policies during training, failing to sufficiently generalize during execution. We introduce a new metric, joint-policy correlation, to quantify this effect. We describe an algorithm for general MARL, based on approximate best responses to mixtures of policies generated using deep reinforcement learning, and empirical game-theoretic analysis to compute meta-strategies for policy selection. The algorithm generalizes previous ones such as InRL, iterated best response, double oracle, and fictitious play. Then, we present a scalable implementation which reduces the memory requirement using decoupled meta-solvers. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of the resulting policies in two partially observable settings: gridworld coordination games and poker.},

@article{Bengio2015,
abstract = {Neuroscientists have long criticised deep learning algorithms as incompatible with current knowledge of neurobiology. We explore more biologically plausible versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) arises out of a simple update rule that makes a lot of sense from a machine learning point of view and can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e., with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on generative learning tasks.},

abstract = {Can an arbitrarily intelligent reinforcement learning agent be kept under control by a human user? Or do agents with sufficient intelligence inevitably find ways to shortcut their reward signal? This question impacts how far reinforcement learning can be scaled, and whether alternative paradigms must be developed in order to build safe artificial general intelligence. In this paper, we use an intuitive yet precise graphical model called causal influence diagrams to formalize reward tampering problems. We also describe a number of modifications to the reinforcement learning objective that prevent incentives for reward tampering. We verify the solutions using recently developed graphical criteria for inferring agent incentives from causal influence diagrams. Along the way, we also compare corrigibility and self-preservation properties of the various solutions, and discuss how they can be combined into a single agent without reward tampering incentives.},

abstract = {We start with reviewing the origin of the idea that entropy and the Second Law are associated with the Arrow of Time. We then introduced a new definition of entropy based on Shannons Measure of Information, SMI. The SMI may be defined on any probability distribution, and therefore it is a very general concept. On the other hand entropy is defined on a very special set of probability distributions. More specifically the entropy of a thermodynamic system is related the probability distribution of locations and velocities or momenta of all the particles, which maximized the Shannon Measure of Information. As such, entropy is not a function of time. We also show that the H function, as defined by Boltzmann is an SMI but not entropy. Therefore, while the H-function, as an SMI may change with time, Entropy, as a limit of the SMI does not change with time.},

abstract = {Developments in the financial sector have led to an expansion in its ability to spread risks. The increase in the risk bearing capacity of economies, as well as in actual risk taking, has led to a range of financial transactions that hitherto were not possible, and has created much greater access to finance for firms and households. On net, this has made the world much better off. Concurrently, however, we have also seen the emergence of a whole range of intermediaries, whose size and appetite for risk may expand over the cycle. Not only can these intermediaries accentuate real fluctuations, they can also leave themselves exposed to certain small probability risks that their own collective behavior makes more likely. As a result, under some conditions, economies may be more exposed to financial-sector-induced turmoil than in the past. The paper discusses the implications for monetary policy and prudential supervision. In particular, it suggests market-friendly policies that would reduce the incentive of intermediary managers to take excessive risk.},

abstract = {Nash equilibrium is the most commonly-used notion of equilibrium in game theory. However, it suffers from numerous problems. Some are well known in the game theory community; for example, the Nash equilibrium of repeated prisoner's dilemma is neither normatively nor descriptively reasonable. However, new problems arise when considering Nash equilibrium from a computer science perspective: for example, Nash equilibrium is not robust (it does not tolerate "faulty" or "unexpected" behavior), it does not deal with coalitions, it does not take computation cost into account, and it does not deal with cases where players are not aware of all aspects of the game. Solution concepts that try to address these shortcomings of Nash equilibrium are discussed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

I revisit this question and assume that the agent misperceives causal relations among economic variables, which may lead to non-rational expectations. The agent forms fore-casts of economic variables after observing the policy maker's action. The agent's forecasts are based on {\ldots}tting a subjective causal model -formalized as a direct acyclic graph, following the " Bayesian net-works " literature -to objective long-run data. I show that the agent's forecasts can be systematically biased if and only if the agent's graph is not perfect -i.e., if the direction of at least some of the causal links he postulates is empirically meaningful. I characterize the pol-icy maker's optimal strategy for several examples, mainly a stylized " monetary policy " application.},

@article{Hopmann1995,
abstract = {The development of negotiation theory over recent decades has been organized around two major paradigms: bargaining and problem solving. For the bargaining paradigm, indicators of flexibility include concession rates, initiation of new proposals, and other soft behaviors. For the problem-solving perspective, flexibility is usually indicated by a search for better, mutually beneficial solutions to problems that satisfy the needs, identities, and interests of all parties. Empirical research generally reveals that bargaining behaviors are used more frequently in international negotiations than is problem solving. This may be explained by the dominance of the realist paradigm of international relations, within which most diplomats are socialized. Since diplomats generally construct their image of negotiations in terms of bargaining, it is hardly surprising that these behaviors should be prevalent in actual negotiations. In addition, empirical research methods utilized to study negotiations tend to emphasize bargaining variables, and more subtle problem-solving behaviors are more difficult to detect. The empirical prevalence of bargaining, however, does not imply that it is the best method to induce flexibility in international negotiations. On the contrary, most research tends to reveal that problem solving produces greater flexibility and more frequent, efficient, equitable, and durable agreements than bargaining does.},

abstract = {This perspective highlights the mean ergodic theorem established by John von Neumann and the pointwise ergodic theorem established by George Birkhoff, proofs of which were published nearly simultaneously in PNAS in 1931 and 1932. These theorems were of great significance both in mathematics and in statistical mechanics. In statistical mechanics they provided a key insight into a 60-y-old fundamental problem of the subject-namely, the rationale for the hypothesis that time averages can be set equal to phase averages. The evolution of this problem is traced from the origins of statistical mechanics and Boltzman's ergodic hypothesis to the Ehrenfests' quasi-ergodic hypothesis, and then to the ergodic theorems. We discuss communications between von Neumann and Birkhoff in the Fall of 1931 leading up to the publication of these papers and related issues of priority. These ergodic theorems initiated a new field of mathematical-research called ergodic theory that has thrived ever since, and we discuss some of recent developments in ergodic theory that are relevant for statistical mechanics.},

abstract = {The literature on economic methodology is concerned mainly with questions of theory confirmation or disconfirmation or empirical theory choice. The central question is usually, "How one can tell whether a particular bit of economics is good science?" Economists would like methodologists to provide the algorithm for doing good economic science-and they want the algorithm to vindicate their own practice and to reveal the foolishness of those who do economics differently. For example, Milton Friedman (1953) tells economists that good theories are those that provide correct and useful predictions, while Paul Samuelson (1947, 1963) tells economists to formulate theories with "operational" concepts that are, ideally, logically equivalent to their descriptive consequences.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed significant progresses in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). Empowered with large scale neural networks, carefully designed architectures, novel training algorithms and massively parallel computing devices, researchers are able to attack many challenging RL problems. However, in machine learning, more training power comes with a potential risk of more overfitting. As deep RL techniques are being applied to critical problems such as healthcare and finance, it is important to understand the generalization behaviors of the trained agents. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of standard RL agents and find that they could overfit in various ways. Moreover, overfitting could happen "robustly": commonly used techniques in RL that add stochasticity do not necessarily prevent or detect overfitting. In particular, the same agents and learning algorithms could have drastically different test performance, even when all of them achieve optimal rewards during training. The observations call for more principled and careful evaluation protocols in RL. We conclude with a general discussion on overfitting in RL and a study of the generalization behaviors from the perspective of inductive bias.},

Productive research in AI, both practical and theoretical, benefits from a notion of intelligence that is precise enough to allow the cumulative development of robust systems and general results. The concept of rational agency has long been considered a leading candidate to fulfill this role. This paper outlines a gradual evolution in the formal conception of rationality that brings it closer to our informal conception of intelligence and simultaneously reduces the gap between theory and practice. Some directions for future research are indicated.},

abstract = {Analysts of the recent financial crisis often refer to the role of asset "fire sales" in depleting the balance sheets of financial institutions and aggravating the fragility of the financial system. The term "fire sale" has been around since the nineteenth century to describe firms selling smoke-damaged merchandise at cut-rate prices in the aftermath of a fire. But what are fire sales in broad financial markets with hundreds of participants? As we suggested in a 1992 paper, a fire sale is essentially a forced sale of an asset at a dislocated price. The asset sale is forced in the sense that the seller cannot pay creditors without selling assets. The price is dislocated because the highest potential bidders are typically involved in a similar activity as the seller, and are therefore themselves indebted and cannot borrow more to buy the asset. Indeed, rather than bidding for the asset, they might be selling similar assets themselves. Assets are then bought by nonspecialists who, knowing that they have less expertise with the assets in question, are only willing to buy at valuations that are much lower. In this paper, we selectively review some of the research on fire sales, emphasizing both concepts and supporting evidence. We begin by describing our 1992 model of fire sales and the related findings in empirical corporate finance. We then show that models of fire sales can account for several related phenomena during the recent financial crisis, including the contraction of the banking system and the failures of arbitrage in financial markets exemplified by historically unprecedented differences in prices of very similar securities. We then link fire sales to macroeconomics by discussing how such dislocations of security prices and the reduction in balance sheets of banks can reduce investment and output. Finally, we consider how the concept of fire sales can help us think about government interventions in financial markets, including the evidentl},

abstract = {"Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and video games. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

abstract = {Careful tuning of the learning rate, or even schedules thereof, can be crucial to effective neural net training. There has been much recent interest in gradient-based meta-optimization, where one tunes hyperparameters, or even learns an optimizer, in order to minimize the expected loss when the training procedure is unrolled. But because the training procedure must be unrolled thousands of times, the meta-objective must be defined with an orders-of-magnitude shorter time horizon than is typical for neural net training. We show that such short-horizon meta-objectives cause a serious bias towards small step sizes, an effect we term short-horizon bias. We introduce a toy problem, a noisy quadratic cost function, on which we analyze short-horizon bias by deriving and comparing the optimal schedules for short and long time horizons. We then run meta-optimization experiments (both offline and online) on standard benchmark datasets, showing that meta-optimization chooses too small a learning rate by multiple orders of magnitude, even when run with a moderately long time horizon (100 steps) typical of work in the area. We believe short-horizon bias is a fundamental problem that needs to be addressed if meta-optimization is to scale to practical neural net training regimes.},

First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on the learnable activation and advanced initialization, we achieve 4.94{\%} top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26{\%} relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66{\%} [33]).

Our goal is to equip the reader with the conceptual foundations of this tool for building new, scalable agents that operate on broad domains. To do so, we present basic algorithmic templates for building near-optimal predictors and reinforcement learners which behave as if they had a probabilistic model that allowed them to efficiently exploit task structure. Furthermore, we recast memory-based meta-learning within a Bayesian framework, showing that the meta-learned strategies are near-optimal because they amortize Bayes-filtered data, where the adaptation is implemented in the memory dynamics as a state-machine of sufficient statistics. Essentially, memory-based meta-learning translates the hard problem of probabilistic sequential inference into a regression problem.},

Here, we developed a comprehensible and scalable CFD model based on the conservative unstructured finite volume methodology to bring new insights from the perspective of catalytic reactor engineering to gas-liquid-solid catalytic wet oxidation. First, the heterogeneous flow constitutive equations of the trickle bed system have been derived by means of diffusion-convection-reaction model coupled within a Volume-of-Fluid framework. The multiphase model was investigated to gain further evidence on how the effect of process variables such as liquid velocity, surface tension and wetting phenomena affect the overall performance of high-pressure trickle-bed reactor. Second, as long as the application of under-relaxation parameters, mesh density, and time stepping strategy play a major role on the final corroboration, several computational runs on the detoxification of liquid pollutants were validated accordingly and evaluated in terms of convergence and stability criteria. Finally, the analysis of spatial mappings for the reaction properties enables us to identify the existence of relevant dry zones and unveil the channeling phenomena within in the trickle-bed reactor.},

abstract = {Despite a dearth of theoretical studies, there is widespread perception that microfinance is an enormously useful tool for economic development. However, an increasing number of households in lesser developed countries are facing the same debt squeeze as those in the developed world, but are less able to manage debt responsibilities. The consequences are much more dramatic for LDC households because a much larger portion of household income is necessary for subsistence. As such, microfinance can become immiserizing for poor families with few assets. We develop a dynamic model that allows households to use credit markets in order to augment household consumption or capital. Results indicate a proclivity for households to increase debt over time, challenging the efficacy of microfinance as a sustainable tool for development.},

abstract = {Recent work in the law and economics of contracts suggests that con- tracts ought to be highly complex and "fine-tuned." They should have many terms describing the obligations of parties across alternative future states of the world; these terms should provide for highly variable rewards for desired behavior and penalties for undesired behavior, and these rewards and penalties should bear a complex mathematical relationship to the value of the benefits produced by the different kinds of behavior. In practice, however, many contracts are quite simple. They divide the future into very crude partitions; they provide for constant or close to constant payments across different outcomes; and the terms are easy to understand. This di- vergence between theory and practice suggests that the assumptions under- lying the economic models of contracts should be revised, and it raises basic questions of public policy of interest to lawyers. What are the ad- vantages and disadvantages of complexity in contracts? How should courts think about the complexity of contracts? Should courts enforce complex contracts more strictly than they enforce simple contracts?},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Association of Physics Teachers. Equilibrium states are used as limit states to define thermodynamically reversible processes. When these processes are understood in terms of statistical physics, these limit states can change with time due to thermal fluctuations. For macroscopic systems, the changes are insignificant on ordinary time scales and what little change there is can be suppressed by macroscopically negligible, entropy-creating dissipation. For systems of molecular sizes, the changes are large on short time scales. They can only sometimes be suppressed with significant entropy-creating dissipation, and this entropy creation is unavoidable if any process is to proceed to completion. As a result, at molecular scales, thermodynamically reversible processes are impossible in principle. Unlike the macroscopic case, they cannot be realized even approximately when we account for all sources of dissipation, and argumentation invoking them on molecular scales can lead to spurious conclusions.},

Functions are represented by directed, acyclic graphs in a manner similar to the representations introduced by Lee [1] and Akers [2], but with further restrictions on the ordering of decision variables in the graph. Although a function requires, in the worst case, a graph of size exponential in the number of arguments, many of the functions encountered in typical applications have a more reasonable representation. Our algorithms have time complexity proportional to the sizes of the graphs being operated on, and hence are quite efficient as long as the graphs do not grow too large. We present experimental results from applying these algorithms to problems in logic design verification that demonstrate the practicality of our approach.

Synaptic terminals and their postsynaptic elements were identified and reconstructed, using light- and electron-microscopic techniques, from serial thick and thin sections. Terminals were found on proximal and distal dendrites of small and medium-sized parvocellular neurons, where they formed excitatory synapses. Some were 180 $\mu$m from cell somata. Approximately half of the labeled terminals, aside from those located at dendritic origins, were situated strategically at or near dendritic branch points. Since monkey parvocellular neurons show little activity during movement, the obvious next question is this: How and in what way does motor cortex influence these cells? {\textcopyright} 1991 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

In spontaneously active neurons, NMDA receptors were clustered at a few synaptic and nonsynaptic sites. Chronic blockade of NMDA receptor activity induced a 380{\%} increase in the number of NMDA receptor clusters and a shift to a more synaptic distribution. This effect was reversible. The distributions of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin, the AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluR1, and the putative NMDA receptor clustering protein PSD-95 were not affected by blockade. Regulation of the synaptic localization of NMDA receptors by activity may define a novel mechanism by which input controls a neuron's ability to modify its synapses.},

This domain poses a new grand challenge for reinforcement learning, representing a more difficult class of problems than considered in most prior work. It is a multi-agent problem with multiple players interacting; there is imperfect information due to a partially observed map; it has a large action space involving the selection and control of hundreds of units; it has a large state space that must be observed solely from raw input feature planes; and it has delayed credit assignment requiring long-term strategies over thousands of steps. We describe the observation, action, and reward specification for the StarCraft II domain and provide an open source Python-based interface for communicating with the game engine. In addition to the main game maps, we provide a suite of mini-games focusing on different elements of StarCraft II gameplay. For the main game maps, we also provide an accompanying dataset of game replay data from human expert players. We give initial baseline results for neural networks trained from this data to predict game outcomes and player actions. Finally, we present initial baseline results for canonical deep reinforcement learning agents applied to the StarCraft II domain. On the mini-games, these agents learn to achieve a level of play that is comparable to a novice player. However, when trained on the main game, these agents are unable to make significant progress. Thus, SC2LE offers a new and challenging environment for exploring deep reinforcement learning algorithms and architectures.},

The paper reviews the attempts to reform SOEs as conducted, primarily, under the modern enterprise system (MES) and group company system (GCS) programmes Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyses institutional issued relating to organizational restructuring, describes the evolution of the SOE "problem" in China, and discusses case evidence of enterprise reform in one of the largest SOE-dominated industries, iron and steel Qualitative field data, collected regularly (mostly yearly) since 1995, were derived from in-depth interviews with executives of ten large SOEs that have restructured as part of MES and GCS programmes Findings - It is suggested that the historic reluctance of SOEs to embrace reform stems from three main factors - the opaque nature of property rights, the failure of ministries to produce a firm strategy for channelling surplus labour and the inability of government agencies to offer a sense of managerial autonomy to SOE executives Recent policies designed to overcome these problems together with kindred ones for separating government functions from business operations in the drive to prepare SOEs for global markets are described It can be argued that China's preference for gradual reform reflects the wider reform context where economic restructuring has not been accompanied by a greater expression of political democracy Originality/value - The paper's findings offer insights from a major longitudinal field study of two of the main programmes of China's reform period},

abstract = {Economic reform in Russia has been described as ‘shock therapy' because rapid industrial privatization, price liberalization and democratic reforms of the political system were introduced simultaneously. However, shock therapy led to insider control of most manufacturing firms, with important consequences for foreign investment. In contrast, China's ‘gradualist' reforms, without privatization or significant democratization, facilitated foreign joint ventures as the dominant means of reforming State-owned enterprises incrementally. This paper proposes an explanation for these contrasting reform paths in Russia and China and then traces their consequences for inward foreign domestic investment (FDI), exporting and for corporate governance in the short and long term. The impact of national level policies on enterprises is demonstrated in a matched pair of cases in Russia and China. Conclusions are drawn for policy, for practice and for future research.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how the Chinese economic reform process has engendered significant changes in the structure and management of work organizations Central to this process has been the "marketization" of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The paper reviews the attempts to reform SOEs as conducted, primarily, under the modern enterprise system (MES) and group company system (GCS) programmes Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyses institutional issued relating to organizational restructuring, describes the evolution of the SOE "problem" in China, and discusses case evidence of enterprise reform in one of the largest SOE-dominated industries, iron and steel Qualitative field data, collected regularly (mostly yearly) since 1995, were derived from in-depth interviews with executives of ten large SOEs that have restructured as part of MES and GCS programmes Findings - It is suggested that the historic reluctance of SOEs to embrace reform stems from three main factors - the opaque nature of property rights, the failure of ministries to produce a firm strategy for channelling surplus labour and the inability of government agencies to offer a sense of managerial autonomy to SOE executives Recent policies designed to overcome these problems together with kindred ones for separating government functions from business operations in the drive to prepare SOEs for global markets are described It can be argued that China's preference for gradual reform reflects the wider reform context where economic restructuring has not been accompanied by a greater expression of political democracy Originality/value - The paper's findings offer insights from a major longitudinal field study of two of the main programmes of China's reform period},

abstract = {This article explains why massive political corruption appears to be incompatible with economic growth in Russia but compatible with very rapid economic growth in China. The common assumption is that corruption is bad for economic performance. So how can we explain the puzzling contrast between Russia and China? Is Russia being more severely "punished" for its corruption than China? If so, why? This article demonstrates that three intervening factors-comparative advantage, the organization of corruption, and the nature of rents-determines the impact of corruption on economic performance, and that these factors can explain the divergent outcomes. The article thereby offers an alternative to statist explanations of the Russia-China paradox. ?? 2006 The Regents of the University of California.},

@article{Xu2008,
abstract = {The Chinese economic reform has recently become a major focus of attention around the world. The underlying rationale for the Chinese government's privatisation and public sector reforms is the view that reformed state enterprises and privately managed firms will demonstrate superior management control and better performance, and hence encourage economic growth and employment. There are very few intensive case studies published in English journals studying whether firms privatised in China have reversed previous losses and introduced better management controls, leading to increased investment, productivity, and overall organizational effectiveness and efficiency. The researchers do not seek to deny the control problems of Chinese SOEs, but question the consequences of the new controls installed during the post-privatisation period. The paper also reveals a declining tendency in employment; altered distributions of wealth - especially to the state - and labour, and a lack of improvements in the accountability of privatised companies. Overall, the paper argues, the aims of reform policies in China, including better control, increased profitability and an improved working life for Chinese people, have not materialized. The paper calls for more research on the above issues in the Chinese context. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the context of privatization and restructuring in Russia, we test two standard agency theory hypotheses, namely, (1) outside board members and (2) new managers are positively related to firm performance. Based on a survey of 314 privatized firms, the evidence offers little support for the hypotheses. Historically, results refuting theories have been launch pads for scientific progress. Our findings, therefore, raise interesting questions about whether the underlying theory is appropriate, whether there are methodological problems, or whether there are institutional factors in Russia's transition economy that need to be accounted for when we test agency theory in a new setting. We address these questions and discuss their implications for corporate governance theory, practice, and public policy. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The past reform of state-owned enterprises in China has delegated many effective control rights to managers while maintaining ultimate control rights for the Party and government. The result is that either the agency costs are high because managers lack accountability or the political costs are high because the government causes political interference. Reform of state-owned enterprises in China should aim at reducing both political and agency costs, which can be done through depoliticization, effective corporate governance, and desocialization. In particular, China needs an ownership transformation with a combination of privatization, denationalization, and pluralization; a state assets management system to limit political influence from the government; and corporatization to establish effective corporate governance which may take a variety of forms.},
